when steve lopez , tech columnist for the los angeles times , one day through the streets of the center of los angeles went , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , more likable , rough , homeless , the on a violin have to play , the only two strings , had .
many of you 're going to the story of know , because of <unk> paper was later a book that govern how <unk> was , by robert downey junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> it 's the <unk> studied and its very promising career tragically early by your paranoid schizophrenia ended up .
nathaniel left <unk> , ended up with a <unk> and 30 years later , who lived there it as <unk> on the streets of <unk> <unk> the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or at the film to see that , so they 're not only the amazing how connected to understand that between these two men are actually formed , but also , like the music that link to move on helping and they were looking at the instrument came when the pun , and allowed is that 's <unk> , nathaniel way of the street to get .
i met with an mr <unk> in 2008 , well , two years , from walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of <unk> first and fourth symphony no idea and i get behind the stage to me to imagine .
he did n't have a very <unk> and <unk> tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers abandoned it 's never come into a baseball world series of creating . and if it all , because of <unk> passage of our first violin at the last sentence by <unk> fourth symphony .



and in just as a <unk> found itself nathaniel , when we do with our first one class in the walt disney <unk> hall started . he had this is a dupe . flickering in their eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke , and about how it does anyone in my sleep , toxins , they wanted .
i feared , not <unk> , but i feared that i do it actually lose that he was in an artist 's heightened immersed could and that i got its relationship to violin have the destruction would be when i started just about <unk> and <unk> and more glamorous forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started -- so easy to be able to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and as i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes a <unk> change in front seat .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible medicine of it said , a chemical response , who gets a catalyst for my game was .
<unk> <unk> anger morphed into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and the way through a miracle , he took his violin and started to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me up to them out to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started going on a lot about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> down to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that they 're not just an encyclopedic know about music owned , but it with you also a rigid kinds of personal relationship combined .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i used to just of my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles know .
because he recorded music playing and about music , talked about , i was coming from this <unk> , confused man that 's still around the streets of los angeles is decided that was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> musicians that 's gone .
music 's medicine . music is transforming ourselves .
for nathaniel that means to music involves talking about health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions , using his imagination and creativity in a real transform .
and so <unk> his agonized states .
i realized that much as it 's the nature of art is .
they were doing this is the reason that we music to do : so we do something that in helping us all , deep inside it is what our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity , in fact that form of .
and the fact that expression and you get us all , and moved to inspire and it unites us .
what nathaniel terms , so we took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family that involves musicians that it 's mind , which will be a talent to recognize him and <unk> .
and i 'm going over again with nathaniel music , whether it was to walt disney <unk> hall , or at <unk> <unk> , because he reminds me , why i 'm asking musicians and i reply .
so much .
bruno giussani : thanks . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen to this .
i hope that they excuse me .
so i have in my life , many fish have argued .
i 've only two , i loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate fling with .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , the best meat , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .

you could be so needless to help you feel like to him to sell it .
i had with this beauty is a sense for several months .
one day , i call the head of your business , he said , if i was in an event and recite might think about sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
there was a company that to solve was trying to get in this tremendous problem for us chefs 's becoming . how to keep that we take fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years ago , we have the sea fish out how we forests <unk> beaten up .
it 's hard , the destruction of <unk> .
ninety percent of the big fish that i think that we love , creating tuna that <unk> , the salmon , this swordfish . they are breaking .
it 's almost nothing left .
so it will probably disney or bad <unk> , <unk> , in our future will be .
a lot of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , so for tuna . a big disadvantage .
he did a <unk> of 15 at one .
this is , 15 pounds <unk> are needed to have a pound <unk> get .
not very strongly .
tastes , does not very good .
so here was finally have a company that was trying to it right to make .
i did they supported .
a day before the event and i called the head of <unk> for the company in .
we call him , don .
`` , don , '' i said , `` just about the fact , to really have , you are famous for this , so far out in the sea grow , you for the environment is not really polluted earth . ''
`` that basis , '' he said , `` we are so far out that 's waste from a fish and distributed , is n't focused . ''
and then put it in addition , `` we 're basically , with my own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to 1 , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one thing ? '' which feeds these you ? ''
`` the sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and that night i lay in bed , i thought , which is the hell 's a sustainable protein that ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don on .
i said , don , which for example are sustainable proteins that ? ''
he said , he knows that does n't . he 'll responds to .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a proper answers to give you . until i finally worked with the directors on a biologist <unk> .
we call him as well , don .
`` , don , '' i said , `` what you know , are sustainable proteins that ? ''
well , he mentioned were some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers of skin , <unk> , residue , <unk> and to cook food processing . ''
i said , `` what percentage <unk> <unk> 's chicken of ?
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .

there was a long to break in the vocals and he said , there are just too much the chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me of this fish .
no , not because i have a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
this is me , even .
no , i 've <unk> actually from this fish , <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish on this conversation about it 's chicken <unk> has .
this point of the fish , that 's another kind of <unk> .
it is romantic sort of the way , where you get to the better , you put his fish about learning , you the fish the more love .
i 've lost it 's start off in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
one of our journalist , had been thinking about this fish in fact .
she gave us to enter reverse-engineering this .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef came upon it <unk> .
hold two times .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish in the best they tasted the tongue , once the <unk> was ?
i ca n't know , but this guy is it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he miguel sokoloff .
and no , he 's the fish in addition to cook and he 's not a chef . least it 's the way that , and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it 's near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on , which basically wetlands have been .
they did this , by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated series of the canals , and they had urged her water from the land out and it out to the river .
now , they could n't do that the work , not economic .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds walk around , what a place , many birds are .
and so i 've since 1982 , a spanish ] operations work with green bought that land .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of the water in reverse .
they have literally to lever thrown away .
instead of the water <unk> they brought the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and when we have miguel , and his company which begets environmental destruction is completely subverted by .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you have something we 've never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , of a million miles away , and everything you 're seeing <unk> channels and the density , lush march .
i was going on there were n't really long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin , one part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? because we were and struggle to us by the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been rolled up to my knees , and miguel , holding in peace one <unk> .
this removes a rare <unk> out .
now again , he said , the <unk> of phytoplankton with .
and here , here he sees a pattern of a pool , that it on the tanzanian giraffe mind .
it turns out that miguel the most part of his career in <unk> <unk> in africa has spent .
i asked him , right up to as a <unk> 's becoming .
he said , fish ? i do n't speak to fish .
i 'm an expert in relationship . ''
and then he goes and the muck up in it stopped hearing about the rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and they get me not going wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was sick to think about that <unk> piece of the few factoids for fish that i 'm sitting on the brink had .
so i asked him over . i said : miguel , how come out there is your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
what 's the <unk> ? ''
now , he goes on me to tell you know it was such a rapidly aspirate system is that the fish caught eating something that they in the wild to eat the community .
the ancient vegetable biomass of phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish to baseball .
the system is as good , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
and the more of a farm is a lot of your animal kingdom not a baseball ?
later on day i went on this site of it is miguel around and i asked him , i said , for a place that 's kind of course , it seems to echo boomers , unlike lots of farm in which i 've ever been , `` how to measure of you are succeeding ? ''
the moment that was to be like a <unk> a <unk> does n't got .
and we came around the corner and we 're offered to the <unk> sight of thousands and thousands , pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker 's my carpet and so far as the eye enough .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look to get their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was very confused .
i said : miguel , <unk> they do n't find your fish ? ''
`` yes , he said .
`` we lost 20 percent of our support fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year , on this site 600,000 birds , more than 100 different ways .
it 's going on the largest and one of the key to private <unk> across europe , today .
i said : miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing you look at a <unk> did n't want ? ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , we build <unk> , does not hard .
this is an organic network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp are beetles eat lots of phytoplankton with .
je pinker 's so the belly down the better fix this . ''
okay , let 's going to revisit . a farm , the animal kingdom not a baseball stadiums and a farm that their success on the health of its predators measures .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way we need to these flamingos covered by <unk> n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the nest maintenance .
every morning to fly it comes 240 miles to farm .
and every single night to fly it comes 240 miles away .
this goes , because it 's <unk> white line of the highway <unk> may follow .
seriously .
i had a kind of entering the penguins in the system , so i went miguel on .
i said : miguel , fly it comes 240 miles to the farm and they go up 240 miles back at night ?
they do for the kids ? ''
he looked at me as if i just a song from the whitney houston quoted .
he said , `` no . they do so , because the food is better . ''
i have n't the skin of my beloved of a fish mentioned , the most delicious , and i like to do n't <unk> . i do n't like them <unk> . i might not be crisp .
it is that <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'll tell you almost never struck it .
and yet , when i want to be in this restaurant in <unk> tried to 've got it does n't want to <unk> <unk> .
she liked sweet and in , as if you a half bites by the ocean , it would take .
i mentioned the opposite miguel , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a word .
she 's the last defenses , until something in the body happens .
it has progressed throughout the evolution has decided to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then put it in addition , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm that your fish that , it feeds . a farm that their success measures at the success of its predators .
and then i recognized when he says , a farm that had no <unk> , <unk> he also considerably , because the water , it through this farm is flowing comes from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , of all the things with it leads , of those rivers , today , no inclination for example , you with them to lead , chemical pollutants , the runoff from <unk> .
and if it 's going through the system , fought , and this leaves is the waters clean up , how it 's <unk> is .
the system is as good , it cleans water .
so not just a farm , the animals that , it feeds , not just a farm that their success on the health of its predators measures , but a farm that literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i carry it , and that they should be doing , because these <unk> , what romantic , whatever 's also telling .
you might argue that it 's a recipe is for the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what do we need is a radical new conception of agriculture , from one , in the foods really good to taste .
but for many people that 's a little bit more radical .
we 're not a realist novel , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat the organic .
and if you say , the things have to leave the future of good food began to assure everybody 's somebody somewhere up and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
please meet be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not because we have enough of calories are producing to the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- this is more than any point -- because <unk> disparities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years of defined by .
feed the grain of the herbivores to <unk> of <unk> , chemicals on the earth , grilled chicken at the fishes , and all the time has been able to agribusiness just say , `` if we have more people less feed , how awful it will be ? ''
it was the <unk> . it was the place . it was the <unk> the american agriculture .
we should call them , what it 's one of the crafts available in <unk> , a craft that will get an organic capital spider eats , the fact , the production from happening .
this is not a viral profession , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> is today face , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not tainted with chainsaws , but with forests , and i do n't walk across boats , and these networks , but with fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how we 're going to feed itself ?
or better , how do we conditions do that every community , enabling to herself to feed ?
in order to do that , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are getting <unk> and it has never really good for food produced .
we go instead , which begets environmental role model of the way .
this is that in two billion years , employment experience <unk> .
you look miguel , farmers how miguel ,
businesses , which is n't worlds for themselves are , factories that restore that instead <unk> , factories , the <unk> growing some rather than just hard to farmers who are not just emitters , but are experts on relationships ,
because they are ones that we want to experts on the taste of us .
and if i really honestly 'm sure you 're a better , chef than i ever be with me .
you know , that 's my right , because if that the future of good food is , it is delicious be .
thanks .
if i give you today , one thing they perceive want it is that the totality of data that we consume that 's bigger than the sum of the parts and instead of bringing to <unk> to think i 'd like that you think about how we added information that can use that changing patterns that appear and we have these trends that you realize that otherwise , not visible held together .
so what we see here 's a typical <unk> to get older , arranged .
the program that i 'm running here , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i 'm going to <unk> can do is that i do you have a certain death filter , i can tell us an accident .
and immediately , i see another pattern , which gives us .
in fact , because in <unk> here that people on the most are and they over here at <unk> are .
we can be a step further , going out and sort of the data , and then again and see that <unk> and cancer the usual suspects have , but not for everyone .

and who <unk> see that this is especially in men is true .
you see so that the reputation of information and data in this sort of swimming in a living <unk> mind .
and if we 're concerned this <unk> can do why not for the content matters ?

it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
you can do n't like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can go directly to a certain copy to jump .
now if i look over here , i see the athletes who live in this issue that appear and the sports .
i 'm a bit of lance armstrong 's a fan , i click this way that criminalize me all expenses show you have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , if i just a <unk> touch it 'll give me , i might think , `` ok , what if i can come up with the subject i 'm cycling , societies ? ''
so i step back and <unk> of view .
now , i see greg <unk> .
and you get an idea of that if you like this information scans , specifically , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , looking at it or <unk> not just .
you 're doing something that actually a bit different is .
it 's something between and we think it changes the way and what information can be used .
i 'd like this idea now a little more to do with about what a little crazy is .
what we 'll give you 've done is , we have any one <unk> plate and they 're going on a little summary , reduced .
the summary , contains a quick the 30,000-foot view , and a symbol of the domain of which you come .

but even in unconstrained view helps us a lot of things .

i 'm going on the idea <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> `` elected , i know that the <unk> looking at the most likely to be repaid in time <unk> `` people the year . '' there are .
this is really important , because it had a realization that 's not in a single <unk> this out .
this is just to see if you one step back and the whole issue .

when i 'm going to look at all these people think i know that the majority of <unk> are . some have come from the science . some , less again , come from the economy . here 's my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , a bono 's a ted prize winner .
so we can now i jumped , and look for everyone at ted prize winner throw away .
you see , we 're going to surf the web , the first time as if we can actually a weekly study that 's not just by side to page , but more abstract .
and so let me show what else to show what a little surprise to be .
and we 'll give you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i like it 's not a browser and we call it ; it 's really have any browser , but you can websites to look closely -- and we make these <unk> to each individual site like this .
so i can step back -- and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
this is so important because you just by the look out of websites are in that way , all the <unk> in the same way they could actually .
so i can be in my trajectory zoom in a specific <unk> .
here is the state of all of this demonstration , which i so far 've given .
and i can sort everything that today i 've looked at various times , again <unk> .
and when i go back step away and everything to look , i can see my trajectory new to mandate , maybe , when i was <unk> . here , i 've got into <unk> ' seek out , here , bing ; you here to live labs <unk> .
and from here i can be in the end to go and they will inflict that .
it 's a metaphor that keeps it 's used , and every time it does this picture bigger than the sum of <unk> .
now , in this world , we think that data is a curse those who are .
we 're talking about that was curse at the <unk> .
we 're talking about `` drowning in information . ''
what if we have this situation we have to turn them might and the internet on the upside down , so that we instead of getting from going to another to go to start by many things too many things go to get out , and as a pattern , who otherwise , unseen stayed with you 'd see ?
if we have this can do , then this is this record is <unk> , maybe a new source self-driving rather than any information .
and , instead of just in information to move to do we know what i get .
and if we know about , then we can maybe even the wisdom and try and pull together .
so i hear on , very much .
i grew up with a <unk> helping science fiction made up .
in my school i went to the bus an education , every day an hour route .

these curious turns out of course , that i always , when i do n't look at school kid , it through the forests <unk> , and went on , the samples , they 've collected , frogs and snakes and he heads and <unk> , all of bringing it home and under the microscope kind of .
i was completely <unk> , you know .


jacques cousteau came to our living rooms with his amazing event that we animals and places and a world of wonders they showed that we 'd never had chief can imagine .
so that there goes very good at the one <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .

that we had to aol at all . if we as kids a book , i read , we took the description of the author and projected you look at the screen in our minds .
my response was the drawing , and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts , and all so what .

the creativity has to wait quite come out .
and what happened is something interesting . what i 'm going to jacques <unk> shows that fascinated that was the idea of a way it 's completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly would go out , i never an alien world with a spacecraft that point . this seemed very likely .
but there was a world that i actually enter that could be here in the earth , and she was also fascinating and exotic as all the what i always imagined was when i found those books had read .
so i decided that when i was 15 , they bounce back to be .
the only problem here was that i 'm going to a small village in canada , who lived , 1,000 kilometers from the next oceans getting away .

i <unk> my father , until he finally have a <unk> in <unk> , new york , down 've done , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> middle of the winter winds in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real creatures , i got only two years later to face , when we 're going to california moved .
since , in the 40 years , the meantime <unk> are , i spent about three thousand hours , underwater spent . 500 of hours of these are in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world around the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich with <unk> 's life , like we can we really hardly be able to imagine .
to imagination of nature knows , no borders , naturally as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until the present day , that i am deepest awe of the what i look at my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean , holding on a lot of the same intensity as <unk> and the time .
and when i 'm going to be an adult , a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
it seemed to the best way of my inner drive , of stories , with my need to reconcile to create , to unite .
as a child drew me constantly <unk> and so .
so there were making films in the way to the images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
clearly were the stories that i <unk> , from the <unk> , `` not terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
of the `` <unk> '' i could be my penchant for the <unk> and that dip there with the <unk> together .
so essentially locked up , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened to `` <unk> '' : for a <unk> problem in this video to solve -- and that we had such a kind of liquid <unk> create -- that we took on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what it was that was the first <unk> <unk> that 's ever in a film to see it was .

according to arthur clarke 's law 's traditionally <unk> technology and the rocket science may not from one of different .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found is terribly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , this must have done in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went into the terminator or two , '' my next movie , even more on .
together with <unk> and created we visited the guy from liquid metal . the success was completely off , like this effect that basic dignity .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was consumed . however , we embarked on the film is a bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences we might sustain that was a whole new world has been attained , a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i started a company , up with my good friend stan winston to the time i made the best <unk> and <unk> was . they called `` the digital <unk> . ''

we did , and lead us as a while a <unk> .
but the middle of the 1990s we realized that , but that we 're in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , so i actually started worrying about -- too slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` avatar , '' written that the <unk> in activist , visual effects and <unk> effects of in the whole new heights way to understand that with lifelike human , expressive characters , that allows <unk> been produced was . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world ought to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put quite beautiful moment . and people in my company , said that we temporary not been able to be , i 'm going to make .
so i 've shifted that , i and made this other film about the big ship , the fall .
the <unk> i 've seen this as `` romeo and juliet is on a ship everything else sells . it was a <unk> epic , the amount of a passionate film .
secretly , but i was actually going to the real wreck the titanic <unk> .
why i the film did .
this is the truth . the studio . i knew that is not .
i draw you do believe that by i said , we come to the wreckage . we film at the real wreck .
we 're actually in the <unk> of the film shows .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to settle .
crazy . but that goes back to look again , that your imagination a reality we could do .

this was no movie , no <unk> , that was really .

and the level there were enormous . we 'd have cameras and light and all sorts of building .
and it occurred to me how much of these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
it gets into the capsule again , i floating in this dark , hostile environment just down , where no hope for saving enough , if you could n't even go back to assemble .
and i said , `` wow , that 's also , when i 'd be in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed by studying the deep .
anyway by the part of those with curiosity and science has to do . it was all . it was exploring , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i 'm in hollywood would n't give you could .

in some of the following features of expeditions i first creature in <unk> seen , and sometimes the things that i never seen before had to look at times , things that actually , they never seen before had and for the science is the moment when we saw her , if you have no words had found .

and so i came up a something that particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i want my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood to ice will put them and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we were to the bismarck in 1997 , and they were dealing with <unk> .
we returned to train wreck the titanic ever again .
we took a little robots that we built were out a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and look at the inside of the ship to see that , which never been done has been .
nobody had ever going to the insides of sifting through explored . you had no resources in favor . so we evolved to build a technology .
well , and there , i 'm now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that these <unk> here 's very similar , which i know that once the band performed there 's what happened .
and i am i do with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm going shopping it 's technically just , but my consciousness is inside the car .
it felt at this when i was physically in the <unk> the titanic here .

this set of this is an exact replica of <unk> of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
they made me this <unk> know that if you have such <unk> avatars and use and so your consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence was embarrassed you .
it was really quite profound
and maybe a little bit of perspective on the thing that maybe in a few decades , can happen , if you <unk> has to look at any other things to do , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> i got to me as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we started in the what we go down and had seen , really appreciate to learn , for example of these <unk> where we do this incredible amazing animals , saw ; it 's sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with some sort of chemosynthesis .
it exists not in one of sunlight jeopardized system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the right next to a 500 dollars a degree centigrade , we call it had been able to survive .
the same time that interested in which i 'm also very much for <unk> , i 'm going out of <unk> from my childhood .
and so the plane i do with people who , for space that interest and it , with the nasa , about and in <unk> and sitting right <unk> planning -- you drive through russia , a variety of the mission that <unk> protocol , branching systems in particular drum and people think that flies we 're going to international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but ultimately , it was pointing out that i <unk> with us in the deepest picked up .
i took them with and <unk> you have access to the world upside down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who get involved in such extreme conditions interesting . i took them to the vents at mit , so they will lay sample , take and instruments , test could and so forth .
we turned that all the documentaries no , anywhere but actually science , specifically , <unk> .
so lock into the circle anywhere from my existence as <unk> , which it was a kid , and the execution in the reality .
you sit in this <unk> i 've learned a lot .
i got a lot of science and learn . but i 'm going to think they certainly , a director to get you can lead to a guide to be like a <unk> or anything .
i did n't make a lot of leadership , before i kind of expeditions <unk> .
because at some point i need to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out ? ''
these stinking movies tend to bring us , no money on .
we play , i 'll just the <unk> a . of fame was not a trail .
all think that i had to get from `` titanic '' and `` avatar , '' <unk> and i would be struck me , somewhere in the steel nails -- at one towel of the beach tweaked her .
i 've all those movies , the documentaries no , for a very small audience did .
not a fame , no pleasure , no money . how do you just ?
do n't you 're all about the task we now , to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there are . you do it 's <unk> because , and because of funny connection that occurs when a small group of people in a team , it forms .

and in this community , you realize that the main thing that as anything is that we 're going to each other , because there 's a job done is that you have any other that can explain .
if you on land back and it says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and that all around , the whole technology , and the challenge , the human capability , if you look at sea works , '' then you can see the other just ca n't explain . that 's the police or with soldiers that something together through , you have to , you know that they never hear somebody can explain .

so when i back to my next movie `` the avatar , '' to turn , i tried to the same leadership apply that is that you do his team of respect and go up in return of culturally recognized .
it was the dynamics really changed .
i stood there so again with a small team up with unknown <unk> . we turned on , the avatar , '' with a new technique that it previously had never happened .
is terribly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we went for a period of a half years to a real value family .
it changed my kind of movies tend to do , completely .
there were people who said , we would these <unk> do n't really good <unk> and on the planet , the pandora 's to transport .
for me it was able to have a <unk> kind of my job to do , the actual process which are in a result has changed .
what we can go ahead of all this to finish ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think the first place is the curiosity .
it 's the <unk> human feature .
our imagination is a power that even a reality we could do .
and they 're aware of your team is important than all <unk> of the world .
come to me kid filmmaker , which says , `` give me some advice , as i do that can . ''
and i say , `` <unk> do n't even a .
it 'll just kind of others to you . do n't get yourself to bet , not going to play itself . it 's to take risks for you . ''
so nasa has managed to <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and when i went exploring that has to fail an alternative to be , because there , i guarantee it kind of <unk> .
no significant to project , which innovation insisted that was ever done without risk of being addressed .
you must be willing to build those risks on to take .
it 's the idea that i can you want to focus on the way to give you . failure is really an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised by doing some , because you can mean <unk> at the foundations are mainly about vaccines , and seed is to the things that we create and deliver that we need to the poorest two billion a better life for people .
but the energy and climate is incredibly important for those people , if we 're even more than anyone else in the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow . it 's too much or good enough to rain . the things going to come out change how it their fragile environment , possibly could bear .
that leads to <unk> . this goes into uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a <unk> bad for you will .
secondly , the <unk> for you very important .
the fact that , if you by one thing the price to reduce that might be able to <unk> was more energy in nearly died on <unk> .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> pushing the industrial revolution in and even in the 20th century , saw a <unk> case in <unk> and so we have the refrigerators -- <unk> , we can become modernity materials for manufacture and so many things .
we 're so in a lovely piece of situation with electricity in the wealthy world .
but if we have the price reduce greenhouse -- let 's take the prize a half -- we make a new boom and this barrier is because of co2 , right .
co2 , warmed the planet and the equation for carbon dioxide 's actually very clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which is going to <unk> lead and this <unk> has some pretty negative effects . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , and of indirect result that the natural ecosystems to be such <unk> changes do n't be able to fit , and sort of the whole systems of their lifetime .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the situation , resulting <unk> and the place where most unexpected consequences are , there 's some of them grapple with , but not too many .
and there are safe obscurity about how bad hire those consequences will . but they 're incredibly severe head .
i have the <unk> times say , `` we 've got really shut down to near zero to get ?
not enough to the half or a quarter of ? ''
the answer is , until we are near zero to come out into the temperature on rising .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have 3.5 feet tall by truck , the under a $ 3 feet bridge to come to . you can then put them from a squeeze firm .
so this must walk down , to zero .

what ? about 20 tons . people from the poor countries , less than one .
on average , i 've got about five million tons for everyone in the planet .
and somehow we have to change , make 're going to zero down .
it 's been decrease up .
so all kinds of economic transformations are about it impacts and we have a lot of <unk> rise of reduction and go to a reduction in america to zero .
this equation that has four factors . a little bit multiplication -- you have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that ables them towards zero to get their desks and this is a sort of the number of people around , of the service that every man on average , uses the average depth of energy for any service and the co2 , and once per unit <unk> will .
let 's so every single factor of individually and look at think we how we 're going to zero to get them .
probably want to take a lot of those numbers very close to zero from .
now this is the basic algebra , but we go about it through .
first we the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is happening at 9 billion over to this , which is at 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> are we could do n't think about 10 percent to 15 percent down , but right now we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second thing is the services , that we use .
that includes all , the food that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> means , those services , almost any of the planet have access to make .
it 's great that this number drops .

here 's a very basic service . they 've got home , light to have the homework can read it ?
and these students did n't know , so they go out and reading your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , they have finally , is good news .
we have something that 's not over time ,
because of a bunch successes in <unk> , from other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there are many services -- which is pretty some of those services for letting go down 90 percent decrease .
in other service , like the manufacture of <unk> , i was 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement in the very much smaller .
so , collectively , if we will be optimistic is , we have perhaps a reduced to get an angiogenic routing factor for about three or maybe even for a factor of six .
but with the first three factors , we 're going to form of 26 billion dollars on it might <unk> 13 billion tons , you go . and that comes to be able to make !
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a key to be -- this is the amount of co2 as per unit <unk> will .
it turns out the question , if you 're going to zero to get .
if you coal , burning , `` no .
when you are contributing gas burning , `` no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , the co2 , except that renewables and my rocketry that .
so what we 're going on a global level need to do is , a new system to make .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders of a feature , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the sort of services is a miracle .
the people have here to the creation of a lot of the miracle that contributed .
normally do n't a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain kind of date , needs .
normally think there is you basically just wrong and some of coming out and not .
in this case , we need but the floor going to give and a miracle in very long time .
now , i wondered how should i really <unk> ?
there a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the worst idea of the people here passionate ?
i remembered looking at last year , when i mosquitos , bringing in and somehow i liked the people it .
the idea was for you really accessible , you know that there have the people who speaks to mosquitos , life .
for energy i noticed this one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment that would be here .
here are so some natural fireflies .
it has told me that it does n't bite . in fact , you will probably not even the glass to leave .
now , there are all sorts <unk> like this , but they bring everybody 's not much .
we need to find solutions , either one or any number of a tremendous of scale and how incredible dependability . there and so for many ways of what 's where people seem to look , i see is really just five to support these huge demand do .
i went and tides , <unk> , merger and use biofuels , playful .
so you can afford to maybe one of the moderates piece , and if you better to do when i expect , that would love , but my statement is that we look at all those five to work , and we ca n't think of them to give up because they were approached it , because all have significant problems .
we look at first of the burning fossil fuels , start burning of either of coal or gas .
what you tend to make it seems that you might just , but this is n't know . i think you all the co2 , that you have the burning of the <unk> comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then go somewhere in storage and hope that there 's left .
there are some piloted 're going on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it to 100 percent to get it 's very difficult to be . and as any unification work for <unk> of co2 to produce , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is that <unk> .
who will make sure ?
who can be not guarantee , which literally , many billions of times bigger than any kind of waste of the second , you kind of <unk> and other things can imagine that ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next , rocketry that .
they also has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question for certainty that you really feel that you do n't go wrong can , despite the human and abilities that the fuel not for weapons have been used .
and what makes you 're going to the waste from ?
because although archie does n't 's very large , they have a lot of concerns .
so three very thorny problems that might even soluble , and the place where you so my work should .
the last three of five , i 've summarized .
there are those renewables , as you 're often be called .
they also have -- although it 's great that they make any fuel you need -- you have some downsides .
one was that 's the <unk> that these technologies create dramatic less than the of <unk> .


the sun shines as not all day , it seems to do n't believe , every day and similarly , blows with the wind will not the time .
so we need to get rid of these various sources that 's dependent on , a way , the energy , in times when they did n't is available , the elevator .
you 've got so big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if we already saying that the power outside the country is , you do n't just the technology , they do need to the risk around that the energy from where different in your heritage .
and there are the <unk> .
and about dimension to show , i 've all kinds of the batteries , which will be made , looking at the to cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i worked with the set of the electronic energy , which the world 's using , compared to . i found that all my batteries , which now we produce , less than 10 minutes of <unk> camps now .
we need so here 's a great breakthrough , something that around a factor of 100 better future will be , when the approaches , right now .
this is not impossible , but it 's not so light .
it 's what happens when you try and this <unk> sources of what would say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the world to put it .
if you hear about 100 percent to support of people , they need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what 's the right approach ?
one of manhattan project , '' ? how we come to come to target ?
what we need are many companies who work . hundreds of .
in each of these five areas where we need least 100 people .
so thank you 'll say , who are crazy ! it 's good .
i think there in the ted community , there are many of activities , there are engaged .
bill to grow up has several different companies , including a name of <unk> the great <unk> has .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies in the great things to make and interesting ways to have and i 'm going to support .
nathan myhrvold who and i pay a company that , may surprise , the nuclear way around .


this <unk> means that you rather than one part of <unk> , the one percent of the <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent of burning , the <unk> .
this is a little bit crazy idea .
but actually had to take care about where we 've long have thought , but you could never had a reasonable simulate that it would work , but since it modern supercomputer to have to do you simulate fog and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like that it <unk> .
and because you have lost 99 percent is burning , is the <unk> very much better .
actually burning down , you the junk , and you can even the waste of today reactors operate as <unk> use .
instead of about the head to break they burn it easy . a great thing .
so , uranium is called incremental is consuming , a bit like a candle that .
you see that it 's kind of a column of this is often than `` <unk> wave of reactors , they 've described .
that solves really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part of today , burn it , <unk> so it says <unk> uranium .
the boxes the u.s. for hundreds of years on .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get plenty of fuel for the rest of the lifetimes of the planet .
you know , there are still having many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
and think we look at how we use our success rate of them .
what should we had a testament to be ?
now , we go up to come to target that we need to reach and then we talk about the <unk> .
many to talk about a more than 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's really important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries to be produced , and , still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement known to clean his .
so , to prove that 80 percent of achieving , they have to the <unk> , including those countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note she says , whether we have the <unk> technology to use , if you see in all the developed countries used is and we 're going on the way of that are you to the rest of the elevator .
that 's great deal .
this is one key to get this <unk> .
if we come from there goes back , what should treat this is 2020 testament to be ?
it should come back the two elements of contain .
we should the <unk> , use to reduce that on the way to gain , less money we <unk> , the lower left is the <unk> be , and it also the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things we can companies , which is n't fully to the big <unk> lead , just right now , or even slightly less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for this breakthroughs itself .
this breakthroughs , we need to floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great of books on the subject .

and you are actually going through and create a framework where this wide talk about it could get , because we need to support of all sides .
there are some of that come together to .
this is a request .
a very <unk> wish that we have this technology to invent .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years to allow us , i could use the president to choose , a vaccine for years and i love , or i could use this desire to choose who is , <unk> <unk> without adding co2 being reinvented . this wish i would take me .
this has the biggest impact .

what we 've got so i do ?
for which measures <unk> i mean ?
we need to us for more funding to use .
if countries caught in places like <unk> make , they should not only about carbon to talk .
they should those <unk> talking about , and they were shocked by the ridiculous , low funds , who is that cutting-edge approaches to spend more .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> a penny .
we need to spread the message .
we 've taken off dialogue rational and <unk> lead and also the things that of the government to be done .
it 's an important wish , but i think we can see him meet .
so much .
so much .
thanks . thanks !
so much . just about <unk> to understand them -- starting to be able to see it 's an idea of scale that investment that matter ?
bill gates : to the simulation in a supercomputer to conduct , all great scientist to get what we 've done , we need to just some 10 million . and even if we call our materials in a russian reactor was tested have to ensure that it properly works , one is just in the <unk> million .
the tough to step is the building of the first <unk> , another billion , and find the <unk> and the place in fact , the first of it builds .
once the first is finished , when he that 's as i promised , it 's clearly , because the economics , the <unk> is so different than at my rocketry that we think we know them .
and around the right to understand : that means creating deeply into the ground to make a little bit like a vertical pillar of nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting to the process in the top , and working out further down ?
bg : yeah . today , you have the reactor ever get fresh <unk> , so , there are many people and lots of monitoring that go wrong thing ? this thing where you get it opens and stuff come and i could cause . that 's not good .
but if you very cheap fuel , you can tell him for 60 years <unk> -- think about a column , which they bury them , without all the <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and it burns : 60 years , and then it 's done .
a <unk> , the self is a solution for the garbage is offering .
bg : yeah . so what we do our waste from happening : you can see him sitting in real time -- there are much less junk shot with this method -- then take them , and we 're putting him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start , we collected the garbage can take that has already exists , the rule in <unk> or <unk> at these reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors run a problem was , what we in our fill and so that will <unk> dramatically reduce in that process .
but while you with multiple people of the world of these opportunities 've talked about ,
what 's the main interest , so what actually implement ?
bg : so we 've 's not going on a place to organized and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there are passion and the people of the company , were in russia , india , china -- i was here , and have the energy minister met and talked about how it 's going to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese and have something in the way home .
this is a nuance of the one thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a quickly this reactor and some countries have these were building , because of this is anyone who 's a whirlwind reactor was implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and more likely to this really into life to call ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that we 're very affordable , we secured 20 years to create and then 20 years to use .
this is like the deadline , the story that we <unk> has illustrated by which we <unk> have to .
and , you know , <unk> , if all well is , and that 's a huge amount of desire , this could easily , often .
and luckily , today , dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of the brain , likewise , when their new approaches worked , the funding for its operator to work , for <unk> can .
and it was best when it 's a number of creating , because then you could be a mixture use .
anyway , we need a solution .
what the large variety of breakthroughs , this is the largest game that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it would n't even without the <unk> been , but the power that there are so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there are some innovative companies .
you know , we know whose job is not just about this , but there are modular way of this is a different approach .

and so there is very different , but the beauty is that a <unk> a million times as much energy , like a , say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can deal and they are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in our own league baseball bat .
if it does n't , what ?
we have to <unk> come to try to the temperature robust to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation , does it 's like when you ate too much has , and i 'm coming in the one <unk> you can . what makes you have happened ? you know , maybe a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> inside of the <unk> calls that 's going to various techniques , as well , to the warming to delay , so we were 20 or 30 years longer than having to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you pray that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't look at age of the insurance to work because one that may be lazy , makes you can continue to eat , because you know that one of the <unk> save it .
i do n't know if this smart , if you look at the importance of this problem looking at that is , but there are now of the social discourse in <unk> about whether you that are available to have , if the things faster , each year , or this innovation longer need to when we expect .
<unk> : you have one or two lines for the to you may be able to convince them ?
bg : well , it’s real life , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
those of the underpinning the case you 're going to are very little bit .
they say that there are negative effects are going to get the clouds to do , the things start shifting ?
there are very , very few things that make it can say , of which have an opportunity in a million there .
this <unk> here 's kind of -- with aids .
you 're doing the mistake now , and you work pays very much later .
and so we 're looking at the idea , now , if you all kinds <unk> is struggling to something to invest , one of you will actually what happened -- and there 's that the investment , not that 's clear . fact , which is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst possibility and there are people in the wealthy world , on the ipcc are really look and say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty while we should worry .
but my dream is that , if you economic can do , and , at the carbon over again , i also say , the skeptics said , `` okay , there are interested in i do n't know it was no carbon <unk> , i wish to be close that it 's doing , but i 'm going to accept that because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that , if you all this time and energy use of the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals to suffer , the <unk> who confront of malaria and so on that it 's a stupid waste of resources , is money to invest , as it better give things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual expenses for the research -- let 's the u.s. government should be 10 billion per year to spend when they do today -- that 's not quite dramatic .
one thing the other things do n't hurt .
you come up to big <unk> , and here we can bring sensible people disagree about when you have something that was not economic benefits , and you 're trying to fund . for me that 's happening here for a lot of the food waste .
unless there , it 's very shortly before a <unk> and funded the only do with the <unk> . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> that you get , a very high <unk> is as if you can only the rich stay .
i mean , all of us here we could get five times as much for our energy we 're spending with his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research to stop being discussed earlier ? ''
he 's still , for his previous stories , with the <unk> associated , but it has understood that 's a very lonely people , who 's and so he will now this <unk> .

the r & amp ; it 's just nuts , how little girl who supported by expanding .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope that your desire to pass it . thank you very much .
bg : thanks .
a few years , here at ted , apropos of peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is pretty straightforward . <unk> have to achieve <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow is build .
the marshmallow has to come up on this .
and , though it really just seems , it 's actually really though , because there are people would be staring us very quickly to cooperate .
and so i thought that it 's an interesting idea is that i and it into a <unk> turns out .
it was a huge success .
i 've been estimated 70 to give workshops the world have done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there is some of this task , which is the depth with his impressions , in nature of collaboration enabled and i want some of what we share with you .
usually they start the most people themselves in the job to orient .
they 're talking about , you think , how it 's look at what 's , they wrestle for power ,
then they invest a little time in planning and organization . you drawing , putting <unk> out .

and finally , shortly before they do n't go beyond what i have to lose somebody a marshmallow and they put him gently move into the top , do n't just step back and `` <unk> '' ! admire them to work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that the `` <unk> '' to a <unk> '' is , because it knows the marshmallow does that the whole thing actually curls and <unk> .
there 's a series of people who are much more `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and among the worst that 's fresh <unk> .
you lie , they cheat , you have been confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are too expensive teams who are much more `` <unk> '' <unk> , and dropping below the top guy 's fresh alumni of <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
how our loved peter tell me to make it 's not just the highest towers , but that 's really interesting structures of all .
what you may be wondering is , what is that ? why ? what about whom ?
and peter 's telling : `` any of those kids to invest time in the head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they spend any time in <unk> .
there are , but yet another reason .
and that is that <unk> trained that were born out of a real plan to find , ok !
it and i 'm going to realize .
then what happens when you the marshmallow for the top 're putting it , they have no time , more and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , is that it with the marshmallow is beginning and prototypes to create a successful , prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they are many times have an opportunity <unk> prototypes to fix it .
constructionists see this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get the children , right feedback , what works , what does n't .
so it 's the performance , using prototypes to work , a lot -- but let 's a sudden , how other teams of them live .
the average for most of it 's around about . <unk> , <unk> create the half of lawyers a bit better , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architect and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the ultimate thing i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles and understand <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build systems to build .
ceos are something on average , but here it gets interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator at the team , they become significantly more .
it 's unbelievable . you see around and see , `` this team is going to win . ''
you can see the predictions . why does this ?
because they 're special faculties to the <unk> have .
they pour the process , you understand him .

<unk> skills and <unk> and combined , lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical approach to get you ca : sixth need to build systems have .
i tried to do is something that 's exciting .
i thought , we enter the <unk> the same .
so drastically , i had a <unk> dollar prize to software for the winner .
what you believe that happened with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
so this happened . not a team had to build a structure .
if someone 's a <unk> level of construction built it looks like , he would have the paycheck home and worn away .
so it 's not interesting that high <unk> a powerful effects of ?
we reenacted this exercise with the same school students .
what you believe that happened now ?
well understood it the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , bad team of men under the best .
she was produced the highest construction in the lowest amount of time .
there 's sort of the <unk> lessons for us , about nature of panic and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually a moment to invest a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i <unk> digital tools and processes to make this to figure out teams to help , cars , games or `` <unk> <unk> '' going to create .
and what the <unk> do is , it helps them to be hiding by accepting enough to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is offering a shared experience , a common language , or ethos , the right prototype allows us to build .
and this is the value of the experience , this is so easy to practice .
and those of them out there are interested , can <unk> park .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow building .
there 's a <unk> there .
they 're crazy examples from all around how people the system telescope and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that 's structure actually a <unk> sports is .
it requires that we all our senses at the task to fix them , that our thinking optimal , pharmacological drugs like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us about .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype of the experience anything that 's needed to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a <unk> '' moment to put it .
and it is a big difference do .
so much .
do we know , as if we 've got a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a certain .
and everybody in this room has to skeletal muscle .
and you have to the past , go to you can go into the future will go ; you can not in here and now we can stay
and i wonder what they would choose , because i 'm going to my friends recently , often asked this question -- look , and they wanted everybody in the past go .
i do n't . they wanted to the time ago , before it 's cars were , or twitter or `` america , looking for the superstars . ''
i do n't .
i 'm convinced that you know , kind of nostalgia wholesale , to <unk> drawn is .
and that i can understand .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i want to do n't want to the past , and do n't know , because i did the explorers i 'm too .
it because data that participatory ways to the planet does n't go back , you go ahead .
i want to say , in this machine , and i want to the future to go .

there was never been a time as that .
my <unk> dying every once they got 60 were .
my grandparents urged her that number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 miles to would hurl .
there was so good as a nine as i started <unk> are .
but it 's not going to people like us , because it is a larger point of this .
a child , today in <unk> 's born can expect , as long to live as the richest man in the world hundred years ago .
you think about if you , that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox : the smallpox was a billion people on earth 's killed .
they have the demographics of the world in a way of new form , how it 's no war , ever done by .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have you <unk> . pfft .
in the wealthy world are diseases , the millions of us from the only one generation also threatened , they wo n't yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
knows anything else does anyone , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that 's both successes of the scientific method .
and in my view is the scientific method -- things to try to look at whether it works , there are changing , if it does n't , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
sadly , it really all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were frequently said ,
and one of which is that despite all our gains in a billion people around the world every day hungry going to sleep .
this number drops , and she gets very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and more than that , we have our ability to be used for this planet properly account for <unk> .
drinking , <unk> country , rainforest remains , oil , gas , they disappear , which was soon , and if we do n't feel about in this chaos <unk> disappearing , we also .
the question is : we can do that ? i think that .
i think it 's clear that we eat food can produce , the billion people feed itself is , without the country , on her life , to rape her .
i think we can see the world of power , you are not also have wiped out .
i believe that really , and no , that 's no <unk> .
but this keeps me at night , the wake up -- one thing that time at night , the wake of living . we have scientific advances are never been so desperately to come like now , we have never ,
and we were also never been able to give a reasonable <unk> , as we of it can .

the people husks of course , in their faith , and it does n't know intimately that you ca n't you remove it .
n't even the truth will they free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his mind , even a right on his mind going to make progress ,
but you know what they 're not that are right ?
they have no right for their own facts . <unk> , it did n't .
and i have a while to come to determine this .
about a decade , i have an article on shots for `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed that in opposition to bump , in opposition to what the end of the effective activity in public health in history of humanity 's .
i did n't know what i should do , so i did easy thing i do , i wrote an article and went forth .
and soon i wrote an article on <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were going berserk .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand why the people thought , if so , `` <unk> , '' why they believed that molecule increases in a particular , instead of a random part of <unk> a <unk> on the amount of nature was .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote this paper , i went on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we tap , we join a , we eat out , it 's okay .
but these articles were worried , and i could n't want to discover why , and i would eventually it out .
and that because data that these <unk> to me nuts were doing does n't <unk> were .
these were <unk> people , educated people you 're decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and i was such total kludge .
but then i thought , you know what , let 's face .
we 're looking at some point , where we actually not the same proportion of progress we have as before .
we 're talking <unk> it .
we talk about it ironic that i got to look at small quotes about it , `` progress . ''
okay , for that is reasons , and i think we know which causes these are .
we have faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science to be lost , and we have no reason you 're not that should be .
you can just a couple of names would say , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can find their own list vote .
there are questioning and problems with the people , of which we thought that , they always being right . be so you 're skeptical .
so you ask , costing them any validity , costing them at the expense receipts .
so , take nothing for granted .
but now it 's the thing : if you see evidence to get you 've got this evidence to assume , and there are not good .
and i can go from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear of life , i do you never seen , and hopefully will never see me .

very scary .
tons of studies have been done in order to see if you would be true .
tons of studies have to be conducted . that 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in , in the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right now , any correlation , no link , no .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we think of anecdotes , thinking , we believe what we see what we 're going to do n't believe what does that we really feel .
we think we do n't have to take a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , then i understand that , i think we do all .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating ,

this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it 's horrible .
what happened that we do that could .
now , i understand that . i am .


does n't very often .
this is happening in this country not calling , but the 160,000 time in the world last year .

but because it does n't it 's happening is , we can it 's worth caring about , and people like were jenny mccarthy , can walk and sending messages of anxiety and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation should n't fused .
they do n't know that these things as though they seem to be , but almost no equivalent of us .
and this is something that we have to learn about that , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .

not fearful , no distress , <unk> phew , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
he says , paul <unk> .
he 's just with a few other people 's a <unk> grow up .
it can make the lives of <unk> , 500,000 in children per year in the developing world would save .
pretty well , right ?
now , which is good , besides that paul is non-carbon-based life and through vaccines that speaks , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just need to stop to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's a terrorist .
if somehow paul in a public confirmation of thing , he ca n't having fully armed guardians statements .
he 's getting calls home , because people do n't give you want to tell you know where his children to go to school .
and why ? because , paul a vaccine has done .
i do n't say that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them on to return to the diseases come back , terrible disease , and they 're going on .

and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .

what about <unk> ? we take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine took me , a few weeks on writing and told you think i 'm a little bit more <unk> .
nobody 's ever said earlier .
they would your child to do n't averse to <unk> immunized . no way .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't <unk> have . and you know what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , no <unk> .
now , i did n't know , maybe he got this morning guy in lagos at a plane and fly straight to los angeles , now , where he 's a lot of ohio .
and in a few hours , it lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to make a long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight it has gone .
and he did n't know that they 're going to be debilitating illness or infected , and we know that do n't believe , because it works the world now time .
this is the planet of paper that we live . they do n't , as if it does n't it 's .
we love this , we 're going to lie to the husks of . we love this .
you have this morning everybody their vitamins to the point ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , and go on the hops going to help .
i know that they did , because half the americans eat it every day after doing .
you take the stuff , and you take alternative is causing , and it does n't matter how often we find that they are useless people who are .
the data of evidence from the time .
they darkening them on their urine , more do you get almost no .
it 's okay , you want to 70 billion dollars for the dark side of urine of numbers .
i agree with them in an entirely too .
darker the urine , dark .
why do this ? why do this ?
now , i think that i see -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate each one too strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should do n't believe . our healthcare is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing and cold <unk> to get us that it can afford .
we go so that way , and where do we ?
we walk into the poor of <unk> .
it 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's quite a serious business , because this stuff is poo , and we spend a billion dollars for quieting down .
and i 've all kinds of little requisite neural networks here .
none of -- <unk> , again , <unk> , again , <unk> , because i do n't even what this is , but we spend a billion dollars for it out , it 's a fraud .
and you know what ? if i say that , scream at the people at and say , `` what anyone cares about it , you ? let the people hold , what they want .
so you feel good . ''
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it really matter is , whether it 's the minister is , who is , `` hmm , i 'm going to the expense of experts to whom mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , of your patients with <unk> treat us want .
if you look at this road entering , where do n't think and magic that expense receipts of science and replace the movements , you a place where they 're not trying to be .
they go to <unk> <unk> in south africa .

hundreds of suffered undue deaths in a country , the worse than any of this disease absolutely will .
tell me , ah , that these things not a consequence of them out .
they get them . that they 've always .
now , the <unk> epidemic in which we face now , is this ridiculous battle between the <unk> <unk> modified foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about how metaphor .
this is an ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , every <unk> , was a lot of the people changed .
you know , it was no <unk> in paradise .
it was no <unk> .
it was no trees . we have this all done .
we have it in the last 11,000 years doing .
and some of it 's worked and some of this is not .
we 're <unk> what did n't work .
now we can it in a little bit . and of course , there are risks . but we can really the vitamin a lot of rice , as well , and the stuff can million people to help millions of people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say , understand that i do n't .
we lean <unk> changed the food off .
why do it ?
so what i always listening is , too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we want to do n't a huge areas in this one thing , it 's wrong .
we do n't want to be companies are living in flight .
we do n't want to be companies , seeds have .
and you know what my response to do all this is ?
yes , they are right . fix this we .
it is , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
so it with science is nothing to do .
it 's quite fond of morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .

you know , in the next 50 years ago , we 'll get 70 percent longer growing food to put them as the moment . 70 percent .
that investment in africa in the last 30 years .
i 'm ashamed . i 'm ashamed .
they need the fact , and we give you get them .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people 's not going to encourage that <unk> stuff to eat , such as <unk> .
<unk> is something that 's a half billion people eat .
it 's sort of a potato .
it 's just a bunch more calories . it 's miserable .
it has no resources , it 's not a protein , and scientists had to make it all right at a .
and then you might ask people the food and would n't been blind be .
they would n't want to starve , and you know what ?
that will be beautiful . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it was pretty .
and everything that i 'm going to say , this is : why stop it ?
i mean , we wonder : why stop it ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about genes <unk> . it 's not chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous obsession with hormones , our insisting on , more food , better food , unprecedented act of food .
it 's not going to the rice <unk> , it 's about people to stay alive to maintain , and it 's time again , to understand what this .
because you see what ?
if we do n't do , if we are so on doing as usual do we look at a little bit guilty , where we actually , i think , not guilty about trying to be , high-tech colonialism .
there are no description for the what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our n't worthy , and we need to the really stop .
after that really fun entertainment so you want you might say , `` will you still in this ridiculous certain and in the future to go ? ''
anyway . and let me , anyway .
now , where you just put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see certain everything to imagine what we want .
we can you <unk> where we do you <unk> want , and we 're going to you 're going to move where we want .
we need to those conversations can now , and we need to be thinking , but if we come into a certain up , and in the future will go , we 'll be relieved that made for .
i know that we can , and so far it in my case , this is something that the world needs now .
thanks .
thanks .
for some time , interests me for the <unk> . there may be weird stuff that 's a magician . for attracting her , unless there , they look at it just like me , as , a deception , which became somewhat true is that if you just for sure enough to believe . ''
in other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect on shown that <unk> , which was just because the person thinks they do with it 's going to be a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there , if the patient 's purely for sure enough to think a measurable effect on the body , which you the <unk> calls .
a conjurer 's going to be not true , because someone you 're seeing .
so we find mutually exclusive to understand , i want to go through a fundamental , very simple magic trick them .
and i 'll show how he works . this is a trick that least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for kids ' .
i do n't have him from <unk> scout magic of <unk> in the 1970s and learn .
i 'm going to him for you do it and i 'm going to explain .
and then i 'll explain why i would explain .
so , you see what happens .
the knife , that they study how can ; my hand , which it 's look at the sound .
i 'm going to the knife by just so in fact become a 45-minute lecture .
i push my sleeve up .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve up disappears , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist right here <unk> .
it 's how you can see that 's going to any time to look at any moving . as i 'll give you <unk> , can zip in my sleeve , villages , or paint it .
and the end with this is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is the knife by my bare physical magnetics watching .
it sits actually so focused on its place that i 'm going to shake someone who can not be the knife <unk> .
nothing goes into my sleeve , or someone comes out there 's no <unk> . and you can all the senses .
<unk> .
well , this is a trick that i often a little kids <unk> that concern for magic of doing , because you can help you very much about deception for learning , if you specifically looking , so for a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably familiar with lots of them in this room watching this trick .
he works .
i 'm giving the knife in my hand .
i say , i quit my wrist <unk> to ensure that nothing in my sleeve up disappears , or to come out , and this is a lie .
the reason why i my wrist <unk> , is the bottom of course , the real secret of illusion is .

wonderful trick ?
back there sitting immediately someone who 's not a childhood had .
so , he 's here . right .
and if i 'm <unk> , changing the finger in its position .
and now you could talk about , why this is a conjurer 's why you do n't seeing that down here 's only three fingers to see is : because the mind and the way that he information processing , they do n't do individually counts , one , two , three , but it as a group does .
but that 's what now is to do n't actually , and then you open my hand .

and when i mean by hand , i 'll have to happen the same time , i make me <unk> , is caused by this movement , unseen , that the first shot up again <unk> .
i assume that hand away . and this is that knife .
this trick , you can your friends and neighbor to demonstrate . thanks .
now , what 's this with the <unk> to do ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that i 'm really just blew it .
i 'm not a doctor or explorers , and so i was going to me an amazing thing .


and that , although almost none of any <unk> -- this is just <unk> .
but a white pills is not just about a blue pill .
what ? that made me really <unk> .
it turns out what turned out that 's not all is .
so reversing these capsules take that are the more <unk> in a lot of pills every form .
a colored the capsule that look at the end of yellow and across the red is that 's better than a white , the capsule .
well , and the <unk> a role .
a pill twice a day is not just about three pills -- i 'm not going to capture the statistics , remember . sorry .
the truth and is that ...
... that 's also the <unk> a difference .
and the form a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> did n't want , we need to the needle reach out .

that creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much worse than a white pills .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to another time to show , if we have a <unk> have .
fact , is that the white pills are n't as well , it seems like the blue pill , which is n't as well , it seems like a time capsule that i 'm not as well , it seems like the needle .
and none of it has some really <unk> property . it 's only way we believe that 's got around with a stronger effect chalked up .
i wanted to know if i do this idea for a magic trick could use .
i take something that obviously a conjurer is , and i leave it was really look .
we know from the one study that you look at the needle reach out to handle when it 's an enormous amount is about .
this is an 18 feet long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to start with a little bit of sterile .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special to cultured meat .
this is my skin . that 's no <unk> from hollywood .
i 'll discuss this needle in my skin stick and by thumbtacking into it drive till you look at the other hand , again , <unk> .
if you the culprit is -- if you can easily in <unk> fall -- i did that a few friends last night in the hotel room my hand , and some people who i do n't know , and what 's a woman who almost 'd fainted from .
so i look forward , if you realize that the culprit is , then they looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part back here is done .
you can see , you can also <unk> , if you like .
so , it 's so , right here , where my ham starts , the bottom part of my <unk> i 'll just a little <unk> do .
does n't really sorry . she does this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side of way back out .
now we 're actually in the same condition that we look at <unk> had .
at least .
but now you can download my fingers do n't count , right ?
so i 'll use them to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what people imagine if you see that .
they say , `` okay , who 's probably not so stupid and <unk> himself the skin , just to us a few minutes to be entertained . ''
now , then i 'm going to show .
what does this looks like ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people back to say , `` okay . i do n't actually seen . ''
the people in the <unk> get right now in .
let 's enabling me tell you up close to show you .
this is really my skin . that 's no <unk> from hollywood .
it 's my ham , and i think that 's <unk> .
sorry . if you the culprit is going to take away , look not going .
the people back or they 're going to go back eventually it 's going to video to see , will say , `` well , can see that 's fairly impressive , but if it was really wanted to be , it would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really want to be , it would we bleed . ''
okay , let me a bit of blood for you <unk> .
yes , this is it .
normally would i 'm going to the needle elements .
i 'd like my arm spill-cleaning technology and you show that there 's nothing terrible wounds of us .
but i think , in this scale here and with intent , from a conjurer 's something real , to do i want to the needle is just in there as well , and so from the stage to go .
we 're in the next days have a few times each other .
i hope you 'll be happy part of it on it . thanks .
everybody talks , today about the happiness .
i have some people the number of books they count , let 's going to get `` <unk> '' in the titles for the last five years or published by introducing and they gave a little bit about 40 up , and there was actually much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest in luck of explorers .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would like to people are happier and do .
but despite all of the tide of work , there 's several different cognitive fall out there is kind of almost impossible to make sure about happiness might think .
and my talk today 's powered mainly by these cognitive just take action .

the first of the fall is a <unk> , the complexity , actually acknowledge .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful throw it 's more , because we 're going on too many different things work .
i think there 's a particular significance in which we do it , restricting those might say , but in and large that 's something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated way to assume that we need to be able to get in well-being is .
the second case , a really confuses most of experience and memory , basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we did n't think about a circumstance that can think , the well-being is affected , without its significance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there are just a way , it right -- the elevator .
now i 'd like to an example , we 're beginning of somebody who had a <unk> had a little bit of my lectures , of a story told . [ unclear ... '' he said , he would have a symphony heard , and it was absolutely splendid music , and very end of the consumption , i have a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it in addition , really very emotional , which has the whole experience was ruined .
but it did n't know .
what it ruins had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience i had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music business .
they <unk> not because it with a memory <unk> was , so this is to remember was ruined , and the memory was all that 's going to keep that had received .
what we 've actually says is that we 're talking about us about and other people think we could be in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> self that in the present to live and the present know , is able to the past it 's going to experience , but basically just the present time .
it 's the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , `` do now it hurts when i want to see here <unk> ? ''

or `` what was their journey to albania ? '' whatever .
these are two very different entities that <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and the two to confuse this is part of <unk> of <unk> about happiness .
well , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really do with a basic reaction to our memories of -- it begins immediately started .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we were trying to do , of stories .
our memory , tells us stories , which is what we used by our experiences keep that allowed is a story .
and let 's <unk> with an example , we 're beginning .
there are an old one study .
that 's real patients who have a painful procedure scanner .
i wo n't get into detail officers hanging out . you today is n't hurt anymore , but she was painful , when that study the 1990s done .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain , and tell you .
and there are two patients . 's her records .
and they 're going to say , `` use of both have been able to have suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b is clearly has n't have suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , `` i 've had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how much thought , these patients that they have struggled with ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient is a 's a lot <unk> <unk> of the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a really vital part of the story is , how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the way that is worse is that they had , where the pain , really the end up its zenith , was . it 's a bad history .
how we know that ?
because we these people by their <unk> asked , and so much later , `` how bad news was the whole thing , total of ?
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
now , which is a direct fight between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even had a plan b is a clear <unk> time .
so what you 're using patient is a , could do , and we 've actually clinical experiments , and it 's been , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of patient is a to increase by just the hose in it makes no one of him a little bit .
this is going to rediscover that the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and so if you a few minutes has power to internalize that the <unk> themselves from the patient is a worse off , and you have consequences that the <unk> themselves from the patient is a much better off this , because now , patient is a 's a better story about his experience history .
so what makes a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory we discover magazine and it 's also for the stories that we invent .


well , that <unk> even live life to be delivered continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and you say , what happens with those moments , ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .

most of you are completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet they get a way , the impression that they are supposed to know what happens during those moments of <unk> happens , our lives is .
it 's the finite resource that we use as we 're in the world are .
and how we they consume it would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> even for us to keep .
so we have the <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and they are really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the deal with time .
of view of <unk> even if you a holiday , and the second one week , just like this is good as the first , it 's the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that does not calling for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation ridiculously better than the <unk> holiday , because there 's no new memory , added up .
they have the story does n't have changed .
and it 's how is time actually the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . of time , very much impact on this story .
well , that <unk> make it yourself anymore , as to remember , and lots of stories .
it 's kind of the one of this was making decisions , because if you a patient who have the , say , two <unk> at two different kinds of surgeons had and they decide what he would choose which is going to the fact , who would choose the front of the memory , the less bad , and this is the surgeon who was selected will happen .
this <unk> itself has no voice in the election .
actually choose , we move between those moments , we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we look at the future thinking , we think about our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future for more than <unk> memories .
and basically we can do you look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can see this <unk> even thinking as one that is kind of the <unk> even <unk> through the experiences that the <unk> even do n't need .
i have the impression that if we 're going to travel this very often is the case , which means that we go on vacation largely on services of <unk> itself .
and that 's a bit hard to justify that i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we of our memories ?
it 's one of the reason that for the dominance of <unk> itself is given .
and when i think about , i think about a holiday , which we put out a few years in antarctica that made , who clearly in the best from vacation with , i 've ever had , and i think quite often think about the relative to go out how often i think of other on holidays think .
and i 've probably from my memories of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes in the past four years <unk> .
now if i 've ever seen the folder -- open , and i would be connected with 600 of the pictures of course i would have an unexpected lesson i 'd spent .
now , that 's three weeks , and this , greenwash a half hours .
because it looks like an incongruity works to give you .
now , i like a little extreme , you do you know , in how little appetite for me on the <unk> of memories , actually , but even if you and more of doing it is a real question . why do we are memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we experiences that matter ?
so i 'd like that they 're talking about a <unk> thinking about .
imagine your next vacation ago , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures of shred , and you have a <unk> drug , so that it 's going to do n't remember being .
now , it 's going to the same travel to vote ?
and if you have different vacation would choose , they have a conflict between her two types of self and they have to think about how they were viewing this opportunity to make and this is really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking , you get an answer . and if you in terms of memories are thinking , you may be another answer to get them .
why we the holidays picking that we choose which is an issue that we had to work out with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self : drop two words about happiness in .
there are actually two ideas about happiness that we can use , one per second self .
so you can ask : how happy with this is the <unk> itself ?
and then you would ask : how are happy to make those moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- lucky enough for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
which are the emotions , the measured it can be ?
and , the way , we 're now just look at a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> itself over the time .
if you have the privilege of <unk> yourself questions , it 's a whole other thing .
this is not about how happy one person is alive .
it 's about how fulfilling and enjoying the person is , if they 're about her life system .
very different term .
anyone who these concepts that , it separates us is the study of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being that exploration of happiness -- long <unk> have on these same way .
the distinction between happiness of <unk> itself and of contentment for the <unk> itself is in recent years , i realized that they had been , and i might be anxious you look , the two <unk> to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , at the more than half a million people put them questions that have been about what you about her life thinking about and their experiences . and there was another group effort in the direction .
in recent years , we have begun to do about happiness or the other kinds of self to learn .
and that identifies thing that we think i was , we 've learned is that they really different patterns are .
they 're able to know how to please anybody with his life is , and that teaches you do n't a lot about how excited he had to live your and vice versa .
just to you a sense of the correlation of bed , the correlation 's about <unk> .
what this is that if you know someone to be met and you 'd just say , oh , and his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size , you know ?
well , they would be one of the size , you know , but there are much uncertainty .
they were so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that someone your life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , they were much uncertainty about how excited he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the happiness of <unk> does .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means that i 'm pleased to be with people who we like that time to spend with people who we like .
there are other occupational pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you that happiness or the other kinds of self can maximize want you 'll end very different things .
the implication of what i 'll give you 've said , is that we 're lucky i do n't introduce you should be a backup to comfort .
it 's a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason , that we 're not clear about happiness can think is that we 're not going on the same things as if we think about life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question , as happy people in california are they will not the correct response time .
if they ask you think that people in california , more happy to be if you , say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about life in california , who think you think of the difference between one of california and elsewhere , and that difference is to say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful about ourselves that decides to how happy people are .
now , but because the thoughtful and thus responsible is , you can end -- some people might end to california , there .
and it 's sort of interesting to track of what happens to people who wants to california to move in hopes , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy to be .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier , because if you think about you 'll remember is how awful lot of the weather in ohio , and they 're going to feel that they are the right decision about .
it 's very difficult to clear about well-being , to think , and i hope , i have you a sense of it should learn how difficult it 's .
thanks .
thanks . i have a question for them .
so much .
now when we found out a few weeks phone 've talked about them towards me that it 's a pretty interesting thing , which had from this <unk> survey ever occur .
that 's something where they 're part of can climb , because they 're going to a few minutes left of ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most exciting thing that we in <unk> survey ever have found is a number that we absolutely not going to find thought was .
we found that in terms of the privilege of <unk> itself .

and it turns out , under an income of 60,000 per year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a lot of representative sample , under a salary for all over 600,000 dollars a year
60,000 ] .
dk : 60 .
60,000 per year , people are deeply unhappy , and they become more unhappy , the poorer , they 're going .
i think about it 's a completely flat line .
i mean , i have rarely go on flat line looked at this .
what happens is obvious that money to do n't <unk> 17th , but that lack of money one certainly misery 17th , and we can create the misery truly , very clear to measure .
in terms of the other self , of <unk> itself , they get another story .
the more money you earned the more of satisfaction is you .
it 's not in emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it 's life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people this database take seriously , what would i mean , it appears all the upside down to ask , everything that we think that for example in terms of <unk> and so forth .
there a chance that politicians that the country , generally a database of the gravity would take and that 's based upon politics would do ?
dk : you know , i believe that there are mindshare and then there is to the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is starting to be in the united states , no doubt , but the uk does it right now , and in other countries that does it right .
the people are starting to acknowledge that they 're thinking about happiness might think should be if we look at the political thinking .
it will be a while , and people will discuss that if you <unk> explore their desks or whether they <unk> look like , so we have that discussion is pretty soon bring .
how you 're lucky to increase can go very differently depending how you think and if you look at the <unk> even think , or whether you look at the <unk> even think .
this is called the political impact , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you look at that <unk> the population start measuring .
this is , i think , in the next year or two decades of the national stats like .
well , it strikes me that this topic is , or should <unk> the most important political debate to track be about the next few years .
thank you in the invention of economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i make games .
i 'm becoming now for 10 years <unk> . and my aim for the next decade is , there are as easy to make , the world in reality to rescue , as you 're in <unk> to save this is .
i have a plan for it . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time to play , more and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
perhaps slightly too much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve this .
now , my research on the institute for the future has been , is the opposite accurately .

indeed , i 'm convinced that if we need to the next century of this planet , kind of people , we have this time to dramatically increase to put them .
i 've calculated that the kind of time in 21 billion hours of play time per week about .
this seems to start doing some <unk> , so again , i 've got to create a way that you ca : if we have problems like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity is to solve , i think , we have to try to play online for least , 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty precise , why i believe that games are so vital for survival of human species in the future are . seriously .
this is the picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings of the play catch . so he was going on the players create a camera put up .
it 's one of the classic expression of playing video .
if they 're not a gamer traits , and avoid them , maybe some of nuances in this image .

if you also play , you see that certain nuances here , which semen up <unk> eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows present surprise .
this is a player , it 's the edge of the so-called epic <unk> you can .
oh , you know the . all be neat . so we have some outstanding players , here .
a <unk> victory is a result , this so extremely positive is that they were n't know that about it was possible .
it was almost go beyond the imagination .
and if you do it 's a shock , that they really do that can do . this is a <unk> victory .
these gamer is coming up an indian epic victory .
and this is really what we 've got to millions of faces of <unk> in the whole world is where we need to , if we are challenging the next century , but are attacking . the face of those who are actually contrary of all giving in the edge of his epic <unk> are .
well , unfortunately , let 's sort of the face in real life , if we really difficult problems facing .
i call it as the `` in life , i 'm sorry , '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , what i did `` in life , i 'm sorry , '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti on my former home at berkley , california where i in my ph.d. studying how we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem that is a lot of gamers have .
we think that we in reality is not the best they 're like in games .
and i mean , not only less to succeed , although it and as part .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean well in relation to the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired , to work together .
if we 're in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us into our best century version and turn , anytime and immediately <unk> are , the persistent , the problem solving try to have been so how much needed , it at a failure , again shot .
and in reality , if we fail , if we stumbled across barriers , bump , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel we beat it . we feel threatened , maybe you 're depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings that we 've never , if we can play games , in games are they simply wo n't .
and that 's what i as <unk> study how did .
why is it into play , impossible to think , you could n't go and everything happen ?
how we can these feelings are to play in the reality was spread ?

and i have some things started to the epic victories of <unk> as possible to do .

but not just some mission , but a mission , which mimics perfectly to its current level in games does , right ?
so they make it .
you 'll never a task that they do n't solve .

you 're not around and turns <unk> . it 's always be detected something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people who engage with you to your very epic mission to this problem .
so we in real life 's not so easy , that feeling that at a <unk> tons employees set up .
and then is this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
it 's all of the positive feedback .

this constant of feedback is n't there in real life .

i get in real life of the feedback , not .

they 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , spent , the virtual asteroid impact of the <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to think about it in context of vision : at <unk> million years , i started our first <unk> upright , to go .
the first upright <unk> so .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we are playing , spend , do it 's only a sense , when you look at the time in terms of the scale of human development by looking at each holding what the most is .
but also very appropriate . because it turns out that we 're using these whole time looking at the play , pharmacological drugs that really change , what we and people to be able to them .

this is the truth . it and i think .
think about once again , it 's interesting statistics , who recently from a researcher at carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . the age .
so , 10,000 hours , it 's an extraordinarily interesting number , from two reasons .
now , , for children in america are <unk> hours to capture the <unk> that you look at school to spend , from the fifth grade , to end , graduating high school . if you never absent .
so we 've got a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning what it means that a good players to be as anything , what they 're in school to learn .
and maybe some of them in the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you 've had his theory of your success , the theory 's success , 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great values science of <unk> that if we have 10,000 hours to and laborious study of one of any subject to the 21st century . the age to spend , we 're going to rise of course .
we 're going to the best they 're doing whatever is to do , like the most important people the world .
so what we have here , is an entire generation of young people who <unk> are .
the big question is so `` what exactly are starting player <unk> right ? ''
because if we do n't figure might say , we 'd like before he had never here <unk> human potential available .
so many people , we 've now in the world , the least one hour per day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> : 500 million people who were extraordinarily well in to be something '' are .
and the next decade , we 've got another billion players , which is exceptionally good in whatever that are .
if they 've never heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy savings and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online , you can play .
you 're expecting an extra billion player in this next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to think , what it 's unclear ] , where we all these games to have mastered is done .
there are the four things that i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine the way that the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , instantly wanted to do , a challenge to rise , along with the belief that we have a <unk> hope to have success .
player i think there are always trying to be a <unk> victory 's possible , and that there are always be worth , it to try and it does n't matter .
players are not vice versa .
players are masters of spiders poet of social networks .
there 's a lot more interesting studies that indicate that we watched people more like , after we have with you have played , even if you 're evil to beat it did .
the reason is that it 's a lot of trust takes , with someone a game to play .
we rely on that someone 's time with us to spend that the rules <unk> be that we can see the same purpose and have to <unk> going to stay .
so it possible that play together the growing of ties to trust and together .
as a result , we build stronger kind of social relations in .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week doing plays to speak , as <unk> .
the reason is that if we need to play , we 're actually more happy with you to work hard , as if we want to relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal , work , if we 're stiff , significant bidding .
and the players are always ready , to work hard , if you get the right up to do n't received .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love this , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> the magnitude of this .
here a <unk> to do it into law enforcement to light back , you know definitely all of wikipedia , the biggest wiki the world .

five million people use it every month .

they 're creating a very epic story .

ok , so that 's four superpowers , they 're going to a single thing to take action gamers are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it 's people who believe that they 're a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that you believe , you can see the virtual worlds are changing , but not the reality .
this is the problem that i 'm going to solve try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he studies , why people as much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of nothing less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he goes ...
not just like me -- i 'm becoming more games , i 'm doing something <unk> .
so he says , that does actually make sense , because player can go into <unk> achieve more than in real life .
you can go into play a stronger kind of social ties that knit together as in real life -- they get more feedback and reward processing in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently is entirely obvious that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real time to spend .
i agree to first time to imagine that 's obvious .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start to the real world in a game in turn .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> there <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the work of ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about how and why games have invented up .
according to <unk> got games , in a little <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine , up .
supposedly , we had such a great famine , that the king of <unk> on to be a crazy idea that i decided that .
the people have struggled . people fought .
it was an extreme conditions . it took an extreme right answer .
so they invented , according to <unk> that <unk> and <unk> a national energy strategy . in one day would you eat . next day , you would play .
and they were so much in the <unk> <unk> be that i 'll play so fascinating , and connect to satisfying to <unk> productivity surrounding them to forget it 's going to know it 's nothing to eat out there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowed it should have 18 years that famine , by one day where were eating and the next was playing .
likewise , i think , i 'll put today , i play a .
we put play a to suffer the real world to escape .

but it does not the end to be .
this is the exciting .

they divided the kingdom on two halves .
you played a <unk> and the winner got to see this epic adventure to shift .
they were <unk> and took on the quest for a new home . they had just so many people back , how it 's food to surviving there and went to the rest of an area where they 're thriving -- they could .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> that later , the roman empire arose , the same dna as the old <unk> whatsoever .
it 's why did scientists recently at the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists thought that evidence of global cooling , which almost 20 years was about what the famine tell you could .
and you might look at this crazy story to vote .
maybe they 've actually their people through the same ones saved by looking at 18 years in games <unk> have and then this <unk> had and so much about the other ones who learned that they are going to the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .

it was the first <unk> in real time the world of <unk> . it was 16 years before .

i want to say , we 're ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent the half of civilization in the quest for a new world . so i took my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> that half of us an hour a day , like to play spend , until we really hard of the real world have solved .
i know , they will say , `` how we solve problems of the real world to play ? '' and this particular question i asked my work in recent years of the institute for the future of the expectation .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it push out how we the future should figure out .
we do n't want to try and the future ahead to say .
what we want it 's the future to make .
we want to make the most result we can imagine . and then why people again , this idea in the reality home .
we imagine epic victories of the front and give people the possibility of reaching them .
we 'll take a comment about three different games that i 've designed to try to make people that epic victories by your own future to speak up .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is in 2007 .
it 's a game , where they were a <unk> overcome these issues .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> so it for it looks realistic it , and they 're real life in fact , without oil our lives . so , when they have to play <unk> , just tell us , where they 're living . and then you get <unk> in real time , and you will show how much oil costs , what do n't it 's sort of food supply , at risk is , as transportation affected by selfridges to school closed , whether it causes riots in there . and they have to figure out , in your real life create , when it 's true about it . and we ask them , i think about to blog , or videos or a kind hiring .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , test . and we have you ever since over the last three years traveling .
and i urge you say , it was a textures in the experience .
nobody wants to his life change , because it is good at the environment is or because we should do .
but if you have an indian epic adventure and you 're told you get it , `` we 're going to get oil . ''
this is one amazing man , which of you go .
you find out how to survive her community . most of the players have in the game for learning habits maintained .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher purpose put into the other than just <unk> .
we have the game `` <unk> '' at the institute for the future of its own .
baseline of this is the calculations of <unk> , that people can only have 23 years in the planet ended up .
this massive supercomputer called the global <unk> <unk> , '' of course .

you know the jerry <unk> , where it 's called `` <unk> '' is . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just crashed , you can save the world .
but in our newest game , instead of only five people , say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player up playing the game was five weeks ' worth .
they were 500 was incredibly creative solutions that you read -- ca n't know , if you know , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we trick at 3 . march out . it 's a game in conjunction with the world bank .
if you know the game to conclude , they gain from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , 19 degree in 2010 .
we 're working with the universities in very <unk> and they invite one , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic to . we have `` level up , for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all invited to this game with young people to share this around the world , especially in <unk> , the benefit to move along their own social enterprises presenting to the world to rescue .
i 'm going to the end .
i want you some questions .
what you think that happens next ?
we 've all those fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have the real world 's not be saved .
well , i hope to me how do agree that players as a human resources are that we 're going to work in real life would deploy as far , and that play a great significance to change my own .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the capacity to be strong social networks to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we all the eminent play games , to build on earth 's another century to survive .
and i hope you 're going to me creating these games have to design and play .
if i want to the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things not sure , that we do every <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games are beginning !
thanks .
i 'd just like to share something that led me , a few months at writing an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write more and my <unk> fingertips , but i was to edit the <unk> already done , and it occurred to me that i never happened in my life <unk> have to get in the word `` evacuating , '' actually means .
i read them a post right now .

<unk> : well , strong , powerful . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and i had first , to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i came to , at `` <unk> '' and could n't <unk> , and i had to stop reading and once i do this , after that <unk> <unk> and they do with <unk> emotional shock .
obviously this a <unk> , old <unk> . i gave me just thought that the readout quite the age should .
but actually it was a copy of the early '80s when i just embarked on the elementary started , and started to my model elsewhere in my family terribly building and to form , even in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i did n't <unk> used .
i 'd like this post , take seriously i 'd be in the world was born , which someone like me as a person would perceive , whose lives in <unk> way that 's a positive side in order to say . today , but i 'll see in the opportunity and adventure , which i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately went the <unk> of 2009 called and expect that i got a <unk> contributions to find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she 's not much better .
importantly , shock to the last two words of `` <unk> <unk> '' `` well , '' `` well . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about what we thought about people think that we deal with these words to describe it .
it 's about the values that in these words stuck , and how to those values , constructing weights .
our language affects our thinking and how to the world , and people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the the greek and the roman , have really believed that the sound reinforcement of <unk> a great force , because what you hear it <unk> , it can manifest .

just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could do , you know about curtailing and you all of ideas <unk> .
it would not nice , you , and doors to open up ?
a person , the top of my door opened up , there was my a pediatrician in the <unk> . dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he says , dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can imagine , most americans did n't counted correctly tell you could eat . so he became increasingly , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful and go to be used for the work with kids figure out how we created .
i found the time that i used in this hospital , i spent , just great -- except for my <unk> .
i had one practice does n't seem to infinity often , again with its fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> building . and i have these down at all hated worse than anything else . i did they hated it . i have you 're haunted . i did they hated it .
and imagine if you ago , i did n't even been known as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so you 're trying to take this exercise to stop , <unk> not succeeding .
and one day he let me at a i practiced the observation -- this exercise was just tiring and i grew up mercilessly , and he said to me , `` wow , which is aimee , you 're like a lot of <unk> and young girl , you will be one day one of the ligament organs .
and when you create , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just an easier to move from dr. p. , so i their exercises do that i did n't want to do with the prospect that richest five-year-old kid in the ward in the second one stick to be . but he got me , actually get started to my daily <unk> through fresh eyes to see . so , it became a new and <unk> experience .

this is just an example of many , like adults in <unk> the imagination of a child more engaging together .


the medical records of view from a look at you can of course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium or artificial <unk> for <unk> body , that would allow people , really all their opportunities to use and think about the boundaries , and you will be their natural fortune was set out of its way beyond to develop , not going to talk about social <unk> platforms that people to be able to deal with my own identity , put up on my own way of redefining , and we need to the world to make groups that 's leaders who they 're going to enlist everyone .
maybe it gets so this technological change and clear because the that there are always had another version of truth gave , namely , that every human society as something very <unk> and very <unk> can give you and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to -- it 's an interesting story , because people to me every time to ask to tell you know how i started thinking about giving in the deal and i 'm about something ta : this phrase that has to me , never <unk> and i 'm always very uncomfortable with it felt that 's worth of getting people to answer , and i think , gradually i can understand , why .
this phrase from our dealings with giving in the living by the idea that success or happiness in it depends on , a challenge to rise , regardless of the way to bring together can experience has to be . as though my life so successful order is , because i the potential to fall of life with a prosthetic way to be able to ask , either way people to me with my disability to sense .
but the truth is that we want to change . so we are from the challenge of coined , whether you physically , emotionally , or even the two is
and i want to say that this is good .
giving you 're not a barrier that we <unk> need to deal with our lives better to cope .
giving in some easy to our lives .
and i tend to do things giving in as my shadow of vision .
sometimes i realize that he was really present is , sometimes it 's not a lot of vision , but it 's always with me .
and i want to save the impact , or the tricky part of the <unk> one person 's <unk> .
there are in life was giving and challenges , and they 're just <unk> real , and every person walks with it differently about . but the question is n't know if we started thinking about giving in the right now , or not , but the way that we really clear understanding .
so we 're not just responsible for that people that we love , in front of <unk> to maintain , but they also on a laborer , well , in order to cope .
and we provide our kids that did n't like , if we do you feel that give you ca n't be able to fit .
you have two things that falls apart : first of the medical fact , an amputee , to be and the second is the societal argument about whether i helped me , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability , with that makes me apart , put it would have to , is that the world , always think , you ca n't help me with definitions that describe it .
in our desire , the people to protect have , we care are and you the cold , hard it turns out of their medical projections to communicate or even a prediction for quality to imagine that you expect , we have to watch out that we 're not the foundation to put that somebody actually has helped is .

if we have a man to do n't holistically and treat , and not all its structural forces and opportunity to sense , and recognizing you 're creating in addition to the natural struggle that you might lead to put them , another disease .
we <unk> a person who had to our society , this is worth .
so we have to talk about the <unk> beyond watching and look at all the realm of human capacities for an issue .
at a sustainable and is that it between the perception we went to mismatch , and our magnificent ingenuity , a connection there .

it 's me , maybe more about making sure enough to imagine that we 're giving in which is not necessarily about overcoming that we need , but that we use to open , you to hug , you can get the <unk> to put in order to go get <unk> to use , maybe even in order to dance .
and maybe you 're creating it , giving up as a natural , <unk> and useful to see and feel ourselves up the way through their presence do n't get strained .
so this year and celebration , we had over 200 birthday , by charles darwin and when he had 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my view , at something very true in the human nature -- pointed out .
i 'd like to paraphrase `` do n't the best performing their way it anyway , or neither of <unk> its way , but now , who was changes in the best to adapt to say .
in conflict -- comes about creativity .

so , again , change and embrace , are the great skills of man .
and maybe we know , well , from which of wood , we clay , if we really ethics into .
perhaps is exactly the point of giving in fact , a sense of swings , the sense of our own power .
we can not true self starts to pay that .
we can be giving in a new meaning that matter , over the tough times beyond the point .
maybe we can keep giving in order to change those .
giving in the stand for a change , of the question , we have n't have adapted .
i think the vast majority of damage that we ourselves <unk> have it 's going to believe that we normally should be .
's face -- who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there are the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , gray person 's really know what 's going to learn when it 's really gets them gandhi ?
i think of them not .
we would love , if we do that paradigm of normality versus another level of the capabilities or the strength to it even slightly dangerous to proposing that 's working could . we get the forces of a lot of kids who release and they 're going to tell you invite your special and valuable skills in the society , emotionally .
<unk> have found that we humans from the members of our society more of men who claimed that have one really useful to be put in a contribution to do .

there are these people wo n't be broken and useless level ; they were as a treat and valuable the treatment .
by a few years , i went in the city in which i was raised was , in a <unk> in the one on , the red zone , '' at northeastern part of pennsylvania , and i was there in a <unk> tomato .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> on .
and i hear , like a guy behind me say , `` well , if you do n't aimee <unk> is . ''
and i turn to my mom and see this elderly gentleman . i had no idea who he is .
and i meant `` sorry , sir , we know ourselves ? i 'm not to you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they appear to do n't remember me .

oh , so the .
so obviously has to do it , is actually click is done .
that was , dr. <unk> , a guy that i just like narratives of my mother about this day to know , because i think of course , of typically , to my birthday , two weeks , too late that came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was on holiday , and so i knew my parents the man who was born , bringing it , nothing .
and because i do n't <unk> was born , and my feet up after them pointing a cause and i just a few toes in this and a few toes in the other foot felt like he was the <unk> , these strangers who had to the bad news <unk> .

really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , collected , they do n't know if i was in a <unk> in the second grade , i had gained , if i want to get <unk> in a parade of <unk> road was , however , if i was my scholarship and dying from my like cups victories <unk> had , and he was using these clips to the students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of <unk> the x 's a factor , the potential of human willing .
you just ca n't extol to how critical that 's a factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> talked further , he said , `` i 've learned that children , if you do n't always something else said , who see , and even if you just a bit of the support to get to get kids in its leaves , you can get kids , very much anywhere . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has been thinking about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone in order for donor shortfall , two different things are .

i wanted to go back to have normal work .
if you believe me that today 's worth , i 'm not quite sure .
and that 's happening because i have something with my legs , i 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change that 's also happen because i was so many people , you 'll see a central florida who was called the door opened up , instead of people to address that i cut , or to me an idea <unk> wanted .
you see , it takes a really just a person , which you demonstrates how it to be forces of manifest can , and they 're going down .
if you find somebody 's going to be able to move your own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do this , and for someone in a critical moment a door to open , then you 're for those people a very good teachers .
they teach them on themselves , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' was rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means that kind of authoring processes , that in a is , the potential <unk> .
again , what opportunity , we hope because now in there ?
in the '60s already been in britain , a <unk> done . were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. and call this we call `` a <unk> . ''
the students will go down grades , divided .
and it , a student will <unk> harder ethics , get the better teacher , etc .

and of course <unk> it 's going to the heart to listen to be subverted the <unk> they said , they were just enough .
and the same thing is it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones who are still in school were -- apart from the students who are going to school <unk> had .
you 're really crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers i did n't know that something changed was .
they were just said , that are the student and that the students with the note to be enough . and similarly , you have you something about teaching and they have treated .

if we did n't want to be able to the human spirit of energy to support to continue to hope to yourself and other people around them beautiful , and find curious , and <unk> to be going to put our special powers genuinely positive a .
if a spirit of those qualities , to mandate , we can get a new reality , and new <unk> create .

so come to dance with me . thanks .
