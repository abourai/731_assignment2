you know , one of big <unk> to travel and one of its pleasures and the <unk> research is , together with the people to live , who try to the olden days worth remembering to . the past , still in the wind ' time , you on the rain <unk> rocks and touch , it in the bitter leaves of plants and taste .
just do n't know that <unk> still move beyond the milky travel , or the importance of myth the oldest the inuit -- even with that matters , or that the himalayas the buddhists , still the breath of <unk> tracking , means the central epiphany from anthropology on the memory to call that 's the idea that the world where we live , not in an absolute sense exists , i just as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of certain ways of customization for our ancestors , although actually succeed , , many generations chose .
and needless to share we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we teach children born .
and we go <unk> .
we 're bound with the <unk> separation from the death on afterwards and thus should n't have the surprise that we 'd sing , dancing and and art produce .

and plays it does n't matter , whether it is just the <unk> in the forest of borneo , is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the soldier in the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> the middle of the sahara . this happens to the colleague , i studied with a month ago in the desert , traveled around . or even a <unk> to hang it 's <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways , other ways to human guidance in the earth are .
and this is an idea that if you think about to keep using only hope will deliver it .
together the <unk> culture , the world a net of <unk> and cultural life that the earth , places , for the sake of the earth as important is how the biological <unk> that has been called the biosphere knows .
you can look at this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can help when the <unk> of thoughts and dreams , myths ideas of inspirations -- and <unk> , by the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , generated , you should be defined .
the <unk> is the big legacy of humanity .
it 's the symbol of all of what we 're and what we call an amazing <unk> species can do .
and just like the biosphere powerful away , has transpired that by the <unk> -- just with even bigger faster .
not a biologist 'd like , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more all kinds about to extinction , because it just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> in the area of biodiversity -- equivalent of hard to what to be <unk> <unk> in the area of cultural diversity is known .
and the defining indicator of this is extinct in languages .
than any of them in this room was born , were on earth 's 6,000 different languages spoken .
now is a language not just the totality of <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of human spirit .
it 's a means , with the soul for a certain cultures have access to the material world finds .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and of these are 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey , sitting , exactly half of no longer in your ears by children whispered something .
they get our infants do n't trained . this is , if nothing done is , they 're actually been dead .
what could be lonely , like from silence , places to be one of the last of your people to be that your language to talk , no way to have the wisdom of our ancestors of science , or the hope to kids to occur ?
and yet companies this horrible fate of fact , somebody somewhere on earth , it 's about all over two weeks , because of two weeks to die in an older people ] and take the last <unk> a historic language of the grave .
and i know that some of you say `` it 's not good thing ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to talk to be ? '' and i say , `` well , do this language yoruba person . let them <unk> be .
let them kogi be . ''
and they would suddenly realize , what about them to get their own language not could talk .
so i want you today , kind of a trip across the <unk> take , a quick trip across the <unk> to try to make them intelligible to do what actually lost is .
now have some of us , the sense , forgetting that i , if i say `` different ways of being , '' truly different ways of being mean .
take you take this kid who <unk> the northwest , the amazon , the nation of the anaconda , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east around the belly of sacred snakes <unk> .
this is a people , which is not being cognitively between the colored blue and green is different , this <unk> the forest , one of people around , <unk> is .
you have an idiosyncratic , language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called `` you have to marry someone who 's another language to speak .
those are rooted in the mythological past . that , idiosyncratic sense of these big houses where the background of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , however , that you never hear somebody drops , who have learned language .
they just hear them and start going to talk .
or , one of <unk> tribes that someday i 've lived , the <unk> at northeastern part of ecuador , an amazing people , the first came back in 1958 , peaceful and contact being used .
in 1957 , trying to take five <unk> contact record and did a bad mistakes .
they threw , shiny photos of themselves from the air down , what we and friendly gesture to rate that would . they forgot about that these people in the rainforest in your life never seen something <unk> 'd seen .
they did these photographs from ground up , along behind the face or the character to see , found nothing and <unk> that this business of the devil population are and kill the five <unk> with his spear .
but the <unk> kill not just outside forces with his spear .
they <unk> each .
54 percent of deaths to happen through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations further back and found two cases of natural death and when we the people with a reprint something about <unk> , put them to that one of people that old that turned that he was based on his age was dying and we kill him still having a spear .
but once they had a clear knowledge of the forest , the amazing happened .
its predators could the urine of animal 's from 40 steps to take away you smell and name , which species that matched .
in the early <unk> years , i was quite an amazing job , as me my professor at harvard asked if i got interested , be in haiti to go and the secret societies have to infiltrate the foundation of strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> were and the venom , that it 's used to <unk> to make sure .
so this <unk> to make sense of i had course , something about this remarkable the faith <unk> knowledge and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .

it 's interesting .
if i ask you 'd like , the major world religions have counted , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will always be playful , because the presumption , because it in <unk> n't religious faith to give . obviously there 's a and voodoo 's just the remnant of the very profound religious thought that during the tragic diaspora has <unk> <unk> .
but what voodoo so interesting things is this living connection between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirits .
the spirits out of the deep water 's evoking the world , answers to the rhythm of dance to the soul of living , temporarily in denial , so that the <unk> for a bit of shiny time to god will .

we are dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you are possessed an actor , you get rid of the mind , and services . how do you damage <unk> be ?
you see these amazing demonstrations , <unk> in a <unk> that <unk> coal turns out of burning <unk> , an amazing visualization of the ability of mind the body like to influence that it <unk> , if it into a state of extreme arousal , displace it .
now , of all people who i 've met was that the kogi from the sierra nevadas , de santa <unk> in <unk> , the extraordinary .

in a <unk> continent were these people are the only that never come from the <unk> conquered .
by the present day , they become dominated by a ritual priesthood governed , the education , as a priesthood , but very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be at age three and four years from their families -- detached and in a <unk> world of dark , in <unk> at <unk> glacier 's for 18 years separate . two periods of each of nine years , deliberately chose to nine months of pregnancy , to emulate , in her lap , their <unk> mother down to spend now you <unk> in your lap the great mother .
and all the time you are culturally and in the values of society has introduced . values that the examination to sustain that their prayer and only their prayer , the cosmic -- or we say that green -- perfect balance to be decreased .
at this amazing age-grade 'll someday they got out of plate and the first time in their lives at age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first light , if the sun is starting to the 'm the astonishingly beautiful place to rays , then suddenly everything that you in abstract 've learned in amazing , glory confirms . and the preacher starts back and says , `` you see ? it 's really how i 'm telling me .
it 's such wonderful . you have to protect . ''
they call the older brother and say that we that we the younger brother , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we of aboriginal communities and trim think , and conjure up either <unk> and the old model of gossip of <unk> wild up , which was in his simplification -- a <unk> idea is or another thoreau and say , these people are more with nature , connected than us .
so , native are n't sentimental , even get them of nostalgia stricken .

now , which means that ?
it means that a little kid from the andes , that in the belief <unk> that the mountain a <unk> is , of his or her destiny to say , is a whole other person , and up a different relationship with this resource , this place , as a little kid from montana , that in the belief <unk> that a mountain a bunch of the stone is that was emptied can be .
if he did the abode of mind or a bunch <unk> is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the wild , defined .
i grew in the woods by british columbia and i believed that these forests and there are , <unk> to be .
it made me to a different people as my friends of the <unk> who believe that these forests , the abode of <unk> and the crooked <unk> and the <unk> spirits , the most <unk> the world , housing , and ghosts , which you , on their <unk> contribute to be .
now if you start to the idea to consider that these cultures all kinds of reality create the ability to do you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . , like this plant here .
it 's a picture that i just last april of the northwest , the amazon looking .
this is an ayahuasca , from a lot of you have heard the best performing <unk> preparation from his repertoire of the shamans live .

these plant contains some more powerful <unk> the point of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> lot alike are .
if you 've visited the <unk> have watched as you this stuff <unk> , this substance that you of various forms produce contains one <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> 's sort of like from a <unk> of mine , to become carcasses from the baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality does , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the guy who 's the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> age started , has been discussing . i was claimed that you have <unk> not as highly hallucinogenic categorize could , there in this moment where you the effects that detects that you do n't there is to a <unk> to experience .
but the bit about <unk> is that they are not taken orally high-power people can , because they go through a in the human bowels of course <unk> enzyme that have names <unk> , <unk> be .
they can only in relationship with several different chemicals , orally will occupy that the mao <unk> .
now it 's fascinating that the <unk> that in the <unk> contain , <unk> of the same way that are we must have to the <unk> to <unk> . ask yourself so even .
how do these people from a flora by 80,000 kinds <unk> plant these two , morphologically just as kin plants and find that when it 's how to combine , a kind of <unk> version of creating so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?

but you say the native americans tell you , `` the crop to talk to us . ''
now , which is that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca that they all at great distance in a forest is recognizing that for our eyes , as a kind of sand appear .
and then you say they 're doing their taxonomy arguably , and they say `` i thought you understand something of plants .
i mean , you know anything ? '' and i said `` no . ''
so , it turns out that any of 17 options on full <unk> and they sing to one in a different modulate .
now , which brings them a ph.d. at harvard , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> to count .
well , that <unk> the problem is that even those of us who sympathy with the tricky position on native , get when <unk> and colorful see , however , sort of the past issue , as the real world , which way our world , progresses .
so , in fact that you look at the 20th century , in 300 years not about your war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era where we <unk> were and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity in the earth either take action supported it passively accepted . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have kept on the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the <unk> heard not less on the sioux to be more than they came and will give up , as america is stopping americans to be more than you a horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology could threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face of leadership .
and wherever you look around the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures are not the crashing <unk> are . this is dynamic living peoples , whose existence through <unk> forces eliminated it 's about their capacity of customization go out , whether it 's going to do with the <unk> logging in native of <unk> is , a <unk> from <unk> , of <unk> , a people that was one generation freely in the forest was living , and i 'm going to <unk> and in prostitution , on its shores of denigrated , from where you can see that even the river with mud polluted is that 's almost half borneo , in the china sea <unk> seems . from where the japanese <unk> the horizon , to see , who are willing to their <unk> with a raw <unk> to fill that you the forest <unk> have , or how the case of <unk> where it <unk> are that during <unk> <unk> were .
or if we in the hills of tibet go where i recently much work , you will be ugly face of political dominance of those .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people becomes generically condemned , but the <unk> , the destruction of living of people will not just not condemned , but generally and <unk> as part of <unk> celebrated .
and you have the suffering <unk> n't know if you do n't it on <unk> level have seen .
i travel even a young scientist colleagues 6,000 miles from <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> to <unk> and only when i went <unk> came i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , in the rubble of ash into some of the work . 1.2 million people that during the <unk> of the <unk> killed were .
the father this young <unk> was as followers of <unk> lama identified .
that meant that he was during the chinese invasion immediately get killed got .
his uncle bug living with their sanctity of the diaspora , people in nepal , got .
his mother was imprisoned in that much punishment on -- for the crime rich being .
he was at age two years in the prison smuggled in under your <unk> to hide , because without it does n't live to .

eventually followed them out in bulk of a tags mao , for this <unk> her for seven years in a heavy <unk> .
the suffering <unk> can intolerable , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .


and it 's very humbling to think that our species , maybe for 600,000 years now exists .
the <unk> revolution that allow us , agriculture started , and we now there 's the cult of <unk> <unk> that 's poetry of the shamans through the prose that priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization of surplus , created -- found was just 10,000 years to find .
the 21st century industrial world as we know it 's hardly see 300 years old .
now this superficial history tells me not that we all the answers to the challenges have we are in the next for millennia facing .
if we these <unk> <unk> after the importance of <unk> questions , answering them in 10,000 various voices .
and in this song , we are the ability to rediscover that to be what we are : people with a broad consciousness , who are the importance are really aware that all people , and gardening a room would flourish to <unk> to be . and there are great moments of the optimism .

the canadian government is not always very good at the inuit usage , and during the <unk> years in with the establishment of leadership , they were forced them , settlements , to move .
the granddaddy of the old man refused to .
the family , the fear for his life was , took him any weapons and all the tools here .
now you have to know that the inuit -- not afraid the cold . they have used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their takes was originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped up , created .
the granddaddy of men feared , not before the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , let his pants off <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as human feces will to market started , shaped it into the shape of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of <unk> and when it completely frozen , <unk> a dog in .
he <unk> the dog and improvisational play a <unk> , took this skeleton of the dog and improvisational one takes , started putting a second dog and <unk> about the <unk> with <unk> on your belt .
so you can pull out there is n't do something .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit -- and all indigenous in the world .
the canadian government was the inuit -- in april 1999 the complete control of an area , that 's bigger than california , texas , right .
it 's our new home and means <unk> .
it 's an independent area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , atoning with its people , search and we can break .
and finally , i think , it 's pretty obvious , certainly for those of us that to these distant goals from the planet went to , to recognize that they do n't actually remove them .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination who were times past <unk> . and for all of us to be the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children of the geography of hope .
what we at national geographic eventually do is that we believe that politicians will never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> it 's powerful , but we believe that storytelling the world can change and so we can probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website you 've got 35 million hits of every month .
156 nations would send our <unk> .
our journals are millions of reading .
and we take a series of trips to <unk> , on that we do our audience to places of such as cultural miracles , take that you about that vibrate in are blinded , and hopefully , they become one after another the central epiphany from anthropology suppose : a world that it makes us , on different ways to exist , we will be a <unk> in a very multicultural <unk> world can find out of the wisdom of all people to our shared that comfort can contribute .
thanks .
what i first , as soon as possible to show you 'll that 's the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft , as part of <unk> ago exactly a year to vomit . there was that 's <unk> . and it 's an environment where you either local or away with vast amounts of visual quality data around us .
we see , many gigabits of digital photographs here you are seamless and ongoing <unk> , more vigorously , in any way of new arranged for .
and it 's care how much information we look how big that collections is or how big the images are .
most of you 're digital photos a camera , but this is like a scan of the <unk> and it 's in the realm of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only what the power of the system like that cut , there 's the number of pixel in your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house , dickens . each <unk> is a chapter .
to prove that 's really take a text and not a picture is , we can make something like doing to really have to show that this an actual representation of <unk> and a picture is .
maybe this is an artificial nature : a <unk> to read .
i would n't recommend it .
this is a <unk> case , this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of cudon in .
and that gives you really the enjoyment and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read what about it sort of medium with several scales is .
we also something on the corner of these special edition of the guardian did .
we have a fake ad at very high resolution on designed that are much higher than at a good ad is and we 've added the content you added .
if you the functions car that you look like , you can see here .
or different models , or even technical specifications .
and it reaches really those ideas on , these constraints of resources available in place on screen <unk> .
we hope that 's no <unk> and other nonsense which means -- this should n't necessarily be .

and i 'm not really not much time to spend , except to say that we also to this area , contributing to be .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> image from nasa .
let 's going to do something else out .
this is actually now live on internet . you can scrutiny .
this is a project called the photosynth , that really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research on <unk> that of noah <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> at the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done . a very good work together .
so here 's live on internet . it comes from <unk> driven .
you can see when we kind of views and create , where we by images to penetrate , and this experience of these redundant resolution on doing .
but the spatial layout of imagery is here in fact of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together watching to the real space where this footage that all around that the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies , were made , 32 . you see pieces of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all the space in relationship , agree trailer .
i know exactly what if i time still have you different environments to show .

i 'd just straight one of the original pieces of noah show and this is an early prototype of photosynth where we first came in summer have worked for them to do this , what i believe that it really the kicker is behind this technology , the <unk> is , and this is not necessarily be so obviously , if you the environments looking for us to the website back .
we had to us to save the lawyers , etc . worry .
this is a reconstructed of the main cathedral to notre dame , the magic relies on computers with images from flickr <unk> . give you just going to notre dame , flickr and they are pictures of men in my t-shirt and on the <unk> etc . get . each of the orange <unk> represents a picture that was in this model <unk> been discovered .
so these are all <unk> , and they 're into space that way in relationship , agree .
and we can look at this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i never thought that i finally at microsoft working with me .
i 'm very grateful for the poem here .
. i suppose they can see that these are many different kinds of cameras are , everything is to of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a very large number of them that everybody in this environment patched me were .
and as possible , i want to some of weird to .
many of you 're of faces occluded , etc .
somewhere here 's a series of photographs -- there are you .
this is an actual poster of notre dame , the right recorded was .
we can of the poster to a physical view of the ambient light .
the point here is that we things with the social environment , hire them . there are now data from all gathered , from the whole collective of memory of how to visually , the planet looks -- and everything is connected .
all these photographs are interconnected and it comes about something that 's bigger than the sum of parts .
they get a model that from around the earth can play .
consider this as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and this is something that through the complexity , with the people use it , growing and they use for the user , with the deployment and bigger place .
their own photos are dealing with . metadata <unk> that another person entered it .
when someone the trouble was doing and all the sacred labeled , and develop business , who they 're all , then my photo of the notre <unk> suddenly all these data , held and i can you are a place to use to in this space to dive , in this <unk> , the photos of other people use and so a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of the other players doing .
and of course , the byproduct at all are extremely rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that not only by <unk> or <unk> and so on keeping them , but through collective memory .
thanks .
. i define you right ? their software platform provided that at some point , in the next years , all images which of someone in the world together to be used in principle , linked together to be ?
yes . it does not different than finding .
if you will create these hyperlinks between the images .
and it 's doing this because of content in the images .
and that 's thrilling indeed , if you look at the abundance of semantic information and i think that many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> to pictures now , where they create sentences input and the lyrics of the website that contains a lot of information about that picture that 's .
but let 's when the image of them with all their pictures connecting ?
it 's the range of semantic <unk> and the abundance that turned out to emerge , really huge ; it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , which is pretty unbelievable ! congratulations .
thank you very much .
i 'll give you some things from my book about the way that i hope , in harmony in other things are you 've already heard . and i 'm trying to a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't notice are .

the official dogma for what ?
the official <unk> of all western aggressive societies .
the official dogma does it : if we 'd like this to maximize the <unk> of the citizens , it 's this , especially through the <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the reasons it is that freedom within itself is good , valuable , good , a <unk> requirement for human .

the way to freedom to maximize is a choice to maximize coverage .


and it 's also deeply into our lives in the root .
i 'll give you some examples give you what makes us modern advance as possible .
this is my big supermarket . no big .
i 'd just briefly about <unk> say .

so this is what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> business for a good stereo put together -- speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , it 's imagination-amplifier ? and in this one electronics about business is so many <unk> facilities .

you must admit that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
it was a time when i was a boy , because you could see every phone vendor would have to you wanted , while he of ma bell was .
they have your phone <unk> . they did n't <unk>
a result was that the phone ever broken up .
these days are over .
now we have almost an infinite variety of phones , especially in the world of mobile .
these are the mobile is the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and you want it till now not in their industry have seen , you can be sure that they 'll soon .
and what it does is it brings people do it in the business to walk and this to question .
you know now what the answer to the question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a cell phone to buy that not too much does .
in other aspects of life , the very much becomes rather than the stores of <unk> are , meets the same explosion of choices too .
health -- it 's no longer the case in the united states that they 're on the doctor or go and the doctor says you what to do .
instead they go to the doctor and the doctor says you : we could a to make or we could b is done .
a has these benefits and risk .
b has these benefits and risk . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what do i do ? ''
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risk .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i 'd see , doc , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- that 's called `` patient , autonomy . '' that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift in the last and responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone to know -- namely the doctor -- to someone who do n't know , and more likely is sick and therefore , it in the best health is a to decide -- namely the patient .
there 's a tremendous marketing for <unk> drug for people like you and i 'm going to , if you think , not made sense , because we do n't buy .
why is campaigning for us , unless we can buy ?
the answer is you expect of us the doctor or the next morning call and to a change of prescription and asking .
something so profound as our identity is now , a question of choice , like this slide show them .
we heir 's not an identity , we invent it .
and we create us as often in new way we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning , wake up , you to decide , what a kind of person you be like .
in terms of marriage and family , was a time , in the <unk> was that almost every one had and that it as fast were married , how they could , and then quickly as kids were like they could .
the only true election was `` who is not when , and not what they 're going to action .
nowadays everything is just for .
i 'm teaching wonderful intelligent students , and i 'll give 20 percent fewer jobs as i once did .
and that 's not because they are less were smart , and not because they are less carefully about .
it 's because it in other things facebook page , you ask yourself , `` do i married , or not ? do i 'm going to marry ?
do i will marry ? do i 've got kids , or just career making ? ''
they 're all <unk> questions .
and they are these questions regardless of whether it is all the tasks to do that you bullied , and a bad grade in my class of wars .
and in fact that should do it . this is important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us every minute by every day from any place in the planet to work -- except for the <unk> hotel .
there are actually a corner , which i any 'm going to be in the <unk> works .
i 'm going to do n't tell , because i use it wants .
so what it means that this extraordinary freedom of choice we regard to work decisions to make , and insisted and again , whether we have to work or not have to work .
we can our children in the football games , watching , and we have our phones on a hip , and your blackberry at other hip , and our laptop might see on your lap .
and even though it all off , every minute of us our child in <unk> one <unk> watching we wonder , `` i should this call would ?
i should look at this email answers ? should i this letter writing ? ''
and even though the answer to the question `` no , '' is it 's certainly the experience of <unk> your kid <unk> very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look close , great things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world where we lived looked like .
my goal , say , there were some of choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world where we now live looks like .
and the question is that are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yeah .
we know what good thing is , so i 'm about how bad thing is .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , is that he 's hamstringing instead of apartheid .
with so many options out of you choose to cut down there are performing terribly hard to even to decide .
i 'll see another <unk> example , put a study about investing in volunteers <unk> .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and it 's about 2,000 different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the of employers was offered to take the entry to two percent off .
they 'd like 50 <unk> of -- 10 percent reduction of staff taking part of as if you just five carry coming . why ?
because it 50 <unk> 're facing the variety of bed , it 's too hard to decide what you choose to that they 're going on tomorrow procrastinating .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's natural history .

by which is n't participate in give them up to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on of the major employer , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis is a result of too many options .
and i think it makes that the world looks with this .
they like the decision really right place , if it for all ages is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong core fund to vote , or even the wrong <unk> .
so that 's an effect . the opposite effect is that even if we the quadriplegia overcome and a decision , we end less happy with the result of choice , as if it 's the way i 'd had gone from less ability to decide .
and there are several reasons for this .

the more opportunities there are , the more easy it 's anything to regret that 's disappointing for the choice to express it .
secondly , what economists <unk> call .
dan gilbert 's a big point of this morning done by telling how much of the way we things to rate , depend on it to what we compare .
well , if we have a lot of alternatives to remember , there 's just as they 're attractive properties of thinking of alternative that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that you 've chosen .
here 's an example . of the most of them that had no new yorker , apologize for me .
but here 's what they had once you want .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive <unk> .
gorgeous beach . great day . they 've all of itself .
what could be better ? `` damn ' husband thinking , `` it 's august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could front of my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the notion of tracing , he 's the opportunity to be missed , day on day , a great car park for .
<unk> cut the happiness that we used by our sample from college , even when the what we chose to have is fantastic .
and more opportunities there to sample of what 's the more attractive properties of selection are in the <unk> magnitude .
here 's another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about it 's going to live and maybe even about things start to do .
but an important thing that he does is : no matter if you look for one thing to decide they decide to each other things not to do .
and these other things like most attractive properties have , and it 's what they 'll do less powerful do .
and finally , <unk> the expectations .
it struck me when i found my jeans exchange wanted .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .

so i was about new jeans to buy for many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd really a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the seller said , `` you want to lean people , easy <unk> or large ?

you want jeans with holes ?
want them down far to cut , <unk> , blah blah blah ... '' and so on told him .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i said , `` i 'd really the way that was the one of the time . ''

i had a better , these large sample of you fill it would be better for .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it myself to explain .
the reason that i did worse , i felt was , in all this available resources , my expectations for what to say a few jeans is , up .
i was very small circuit . i had no particular expectation when it was just in a way out there .
when you in a hundred species , did damn , one of you would be perfect idea ,
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compared me what i had received a part of what i expected , and what i had responded very disappointing in comparison with what i expected .
this note of opportunities in the life of people increases inevitably the expectations and people have about how well these opportunities to be .
and this gets to less of satisfaction with the results that even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of <unk> know that , because if they were to know you all about it 's what this is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything was better than anything worse , from anything worse , was this for the people could experience to make the a fun surprise was .
now , in the world where we live -- we 're wealthy , aggressive people , with perfect , as an expectation -- the best for that you ever have hope it 's the things are so good at how it of you anticipated .
you will never pleasurable to surprise , because their hopes , my expectations , down are .
the secret to happiness -- that 's what they all came up -- the secret to happiness is small circuit .
i 'd say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i 've got a woman married my science , and it 's really wonderful .
i would n't do better together . i 'm not <unk> .

finally , a consequence of <unk> a bad sitting jeans , if it just a way to buy out there is that if you unhappy , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans available , and they buy one of anticlimactic is , and they ask why , who is responsible for ?
it 's also clear that the answer the question is , you .
they 'd better taste it can do .
by 100 different kinds of jeans the windows , they have no excuse for error .
and so , if human decision , and even though the results of choices are good , they feel disappointed about , they blame itself .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and nor suicide , is that people have experienced the very disappointing are because their standards , as much about . and then , if you hear those experiences himself will tell you need to think it would your fault .
and so that 's <unk> that it 's generally better off , objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so let me tell you remember .
this is the official dogma for this one that we all of the best , completely wrong one . it 's not true .
there are no question of anything that choice is better than any , but it follows not that more choice is better than some selection .
there 's a magical lot . i know what it 's .

now , as a policy question -- i 'm almost done -- as a policy question that thing about the time thinking . that 's what all these large sample , allowed in the aggressive societies that 's the material that wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we have a lot of you heard -- which is n't really the way too large selection is .
your problem is that they are good enough to have .
so the things about the i 'm telling you 're an odd thing with the modern , rich , western companies .
and what 's as frustrating and pissed off is : steve levitt , here yesterday about talks like that expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i telling you is that expensive , complicated decision -- it 's not just , they do n't help .
they do of hurts .
they make sure that we deal there are .
if something about what people in our society that allows these decisions to meet to the societies where people to deal of choice has shifted , `` would not only that people 's lives better , but we would also be fixed .
economists call this a <unk> bid .
<unk> will make sure that there any better dancer walks -- not only the poor -- because all these large sample of us <unk> .
finally , read you saying this cartoon , and , a refined in person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , is shortsighted view of the world -- and that 's the way i it before i 've read .
more i but thinking of the more i came to the view that the fish to know .
because the truth is that if you just <unk> break , so that everything possible , you have no individual liberty . they have paralysis .
if you just <unk> break , so that everything is possible to reduce your happiness .
you increase the quadriplegia and cut the happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost a complete security to be limited -- possibly also for fish , definitely for us .

thank you so much .
you know , i think about some of projects we already been talking about the genome and what it could mean , and over the discovery of new tool groups of genes .
actually turn us from a new thing : we have the biology digitized , and now we try to the digital code within a new phase of biology get to make new life create , and build .
we have been trying significant of questions .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and this on different floors .
we have different approaches tried to it up on the minimum of the components to simplify it .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we do <unk> have sequenced <unk> the transition from analog world of biology to digital world , the computer .
now we try to about whether we live regenerate them or whether we new life to create , because of the digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , into mycoplasma <unk> , of the smallest genome a species has the program to the lab and replicate it . and we tried to see if we do with a pretty much smaller genome we can do .
we 've done it at least a hundred genes to get rid of the 500 or something that are .
but if we turn those metabolic map we 'll show that very simple , is relative to our . trust me , this is straightforward . but if we all those genes for looking at the we 've got one after another eliminate can it 's very unlikely that this is a living cell 're going .
so we decided to be the only way forward is that chromosome out to synthesize allowing us to the individual elements of footholds , so some of the fundamental problems of questions .
and so we started with the question , we can a chromosome we could synthesize several ?
it gives the chemistry that really big molecule to make it would never been made ?
and when we can , we can that chromosome start ?
a chromosome so by just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our actions in a digitization of life got exponential .
our ability genetic code to write it 's very slowly build but nevertheless , increased . and our final point was going on an exponential curve box .
we 've got 15 years ago started .
it was actually is a few years to start with a <unk> review before we were first experiments done .
how <unk> is <unk> very difficult .
there are tens of machines around the world the pieces of dna can make , to 30 letters for but it 's a <unk> process , so the longer you a piece of power , the more error is happening .
so we had a new method or whatever we take in these little pieces together and the error correct could .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital data , a genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's a little virus of bacteria and killing .
we created and pieces , making an <unk> and had a dna molecule of approximately 5,000 letters .
the exciting time period ended when we this piece <unk> chemical in recorded and in a bacteria crackers , and the bacteria made the genetic code to read and went viral particles .

recently i worked with the <unk> spoken and they said that they do this model just <unk> .
they laughed more than you what this is going .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software in your hardware we can build in a biological systems .
but we wanted to go beyond gone on . we wanted a whole <unk> chromosome ; building . it has over <unk> letters genetic code . so we thought that we do we build it in a reflective tapes , of the size of the virus to what we the size of tapes footholds that would be able to understand what the individual elements of living cell is .
design is key , and if you with digital data in the computer actually start to have this digital data really bulletproof yet be .

we looked at <unk> 30 mistakes . if we are <unk> sequence , using , if it would never been able <unk> .
and part of design is , and pieces at creating the 50 letter , we 've been and the in other <unk> pieces overlap need to get smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique elements of this is embedded .
you might have heard that we <unk> embedded in .
think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> this letter -- these letters <unk> about 20 amino acids , and here 's a single do for each of amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using to our words to write sentences , thoughts .
initially we 've only signed .
some people were frustrated that it 's not enjoy poetry was .
we have the pieces constructed so that we just look at the enzyme deconstruct their . there are enzymes are the repair and stitch back .
and we started off pieces at creating , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters informational , put it with high-intensity to <unk> in going to have this back to self-assemble , to <unk> .
in every time we have those pieces of the surplus , makes us to sequence them could , because we tried a very robust process to create whatever they in a minute 'll see .
we tried to the point of <unk> to get .
so that looks like a <unk> .

we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> is called , which biology is used to disrupt dna to repair that these pieces together using it .
here 's an example of . there 's an organism called <unk> <unk> the three million cycle of radiation survived .
you see the upper field , his chromosome out one hole falling .
12 to 24 hours later , , it all over so <unk> how it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can totally dried-up , they can even in a vacuum life .
i 'm absolutely positive that live in space that exists and you can move forward to search of <unk> conditions .
in fact that nasa has shown that 's a lot of it out there .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by actually this process is used to have -- actually we 've just <unk> used to the right design the ones we have them <unk> . yeast and momentarily and then automatically comes together .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
it 's a big molecule that we actually with <unk> can see .
it 's footage of a period of six seconds .
this is the <unk> that we recently finished have asked .
that 's over <unk> letters of genetic code . it 's the largest molecule at <unk> structure that ever of people was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we 've got a <unk> of 10 and with the distances print would it would <unk> pages inside itself , just about this genetic code <unk> .
now how to launch it 's a chromosome 7 ? how we activate it ?
obviously is that it with a virus very simple one . it 's more complicated with bacteria , indeed .
it 's also be easier if you 're in <unk> like we 're doing : you just take the nuclei out and i 've got another in , and that 's exactly what they all over the cloning 've heard .
in <unk> is that chromosome into the cells integrated but recently , we 've shown that you a complete transplant a chromosome from one cell to another now , and to activate it .
we <unk> the chromosome one <unk> , roughly , these two so far apart as people or mice , we gave some <unk> to us to that chromosome out an individual could . we <unk> , this enzyme wash to each other proteins to trash . and it was very amazing when we 're in a cell gave -- and they will our very <unk> graphics is low estimate --
the new chromosome went into the cell .
indeed we thought that 's the end is , but we tried to the process something beyond to bring .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here 's a second chromosome took or a third of <unk> , every time with thousands of things in just a second to a species <unk> .
people so that take evolutionary thinking as a gene that to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology missed .
there are enzymes are <unk> 're called the fact , dna to digest .
the chromosome so in the cell was really none of the chromosomes are we added to have already .
it was in the cell <unk> and recognized the other on chromosome from alien material <unk> it and so we had the end just a cell with a new chromosome .
it goes up in blue because of genes that we added had .
and after a very short time had it all the characteristics of species over and converted completely in a new species based on the new software that we in the cells have given .
all these proteins that changed the membranes changed to -- when we the genetic code exposed to it was exactly what we transferred to have .
it may like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by the <unk> move things was quite dramatic change .
now i argued that these are not the <unk> is -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i have argued that we might help you 're a new kind of <unk> explosion of creating in this massive new <unk> based on this digital design might be .
why should we do ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we 're starting from four to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .


we have problems with food , with <unk> and clean water , medicine , fuel of 6.5 billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . this is a hundred million <unk> day .
if we have co-adapted think or some process by eight to replace , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , they have all the co2 from this material that in the atmosphere lands .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i believe that the <unk> the future are .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of the it happened .
we find is primarily of the limits on the biological reality and those our imagination .
we 've now technologies are given this rapid <unk> to to do what we <unk> genetics and we call .
we have now the possibility of robots to build the millions of chromosomes day can create .
if you imagine those 20 million various genes to make or the processes to maximize to <unk> make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a very small team more <unk> change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can drive to the viability <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a tape of actually <unk> at the 're working with , you actually sit down and new species on computers to design <unk>
you know , we do n't necessarily as it look into . we know exactly how their genetic code looks into .
we focus on us now on fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn with ethanol seen what just a bad experiment is .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon paint it will be much higher <unk> will have , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but how we think that one of distinguishing between biological effect of no further increase in the cost of food or the restriction of their availability will have is if we co2 as a source material see , and so we work at cells that this going away ,
and we think that we were first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a way .
-- but in our glow of the world , we 've all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we operate in 1996 , described to have .
he lives in the deep , about <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane to under the use of hydrogen than power .

within a short , we believe we could be able to be one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we really -- <unk> goals of the backup throughout the petrochemical industry . right . if you do n't look at ted could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy to be .
but as we work currently , on the same two approaches to the development of <unk> use .
they have this year with the flu , we 're always a year , back off and have a dollar a little bit , if it around the right vaccine that goes .
i think that changed can be by <unk> vaccines around the <unk> created .
that 's what the future , possibly could look at changes , can now the <unk> sped up in synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we 're years away from people to improve . our goal is merely suspected that we have a chance long enough to survive to be potentially to do . thanks !
on the last ted conference room gave me an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised back to come to them to explain how the machine works .
it 's so far . and for all those who did n't there were , the lhc is the largest scientific experiments which is that the neighborhoods in there was 27 miles in diameter .
his job is , the conditions to create , which means less than a <unk> minute after dawn of the universe existed -- and it up to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just transforming ambitious .
this is the machine below in geneva .
we 're taking pictures of <unk> in detectors on .
in that i work . he called a atlas detector , six meters in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
so a spectacular picture of an atlas off in the construction to the scale of those .
the 10th of september this last year went to the machine first came up .
and this picture was an atlas succeeded .
it caused indicating <unk> in <unk> .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which all the way around the lhc <unk> , trying to a part of the lhc <unk> to a rain of particles in the detector roaring on .
in other words , when we this picture of 10 to say 9/11 did n't see , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory is .
i do n't know if it 's going to the largest <unk> generated , or so when someone the google site went and the <unk> so we found .
it means that we have a cultural difference was dwarfed by the science and reached .
at least one week after a problem with the machine , which correlated with these <unk> here to do -- this golden wires here
those wires , guiding <unk> <unk> if the machine on <unk> 's going .
now , the engineers of you will they look and say , `` no they do n't . they 're little wires . ''
you can afford it , because if you very far <unk> , you 're going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , so , cooler than the space between the stars , can actually wires the tension bear .
in one of connections , between thinking about <unk> magnet inside of the lhc , saw a <unk> .
as heating up the wires slightly and <unk> <unk> met a sudden <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , and it 's another wonderful when you imagine that the magnet for 20 tons to weigh up and by about . inches enter .
we are damaged all about 50 the magnet
and did you remove what we also did .
we <unk> rewriting them , <unk> you .
they 're all back on its way back .
so late march is the lhc switches back <unk> be .
we 'll give him turn up , and expecting very first data in june , july , collecting , to make and put our journey on to find out what the <unk> the universe are .
well , obviously , in a way hardly at those accidents , again the debate about the value of science and <unk> on such boundary . it 's easy to have to reject .
i think the fact that it 's hard to the fact that we control our barriers get access to make the value of things like the lhc .
i 'll put my closing words of an english scientist me . humphrey davy , the way that i suspect , when he 's useless experiments in his <unk> defended us to be an apprentice did michael <unk> , this , she said , nothing is such dangerous for the evolution of human spirit than people assume that our scientific ideas finally , that 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that it 's no new worlds to seize that there . ''
thanks .
i 'm a writer .
to write books is my profession , but it 's obviously , more than that .
and is my true , serving life love and fascination .
and i expect to actually , it ever change is .
but it 's recent something weird for my life and my career break that i drove me , my relationship to this work perfectly to revisit .
this idiosyncratic event recently , that i recently a book -- did a biography is called <unk> , ' , <unk> -- that , decided not unlike all my previous books from <unk> set up in the world expectation and a big <unk> , international <unk> was .
the result is that i , anywhere i come to treat 'm being the crashing <unk> .
seriously -- the crashing <unk> .
for example , they come up really worried up to me and saying : if you do n't know they this success never going to beat them ?
they have no fear that they all their lives <unk> and i will never a book put together , that anybody in the world who cares ? never again ? ''
okay , this is confidence .
it will be however , worse , if i 'm not remind you would require that i , over 20 years , when i was growing first came from being told me to a writer , i wanted to build the same kind of <unk> response been faced was .
people said , <unk> you 're not fearful , never succeed to have ?
did n't worry that you the humiliation of rejection kills ?
did n't afraid you to be the craft your life <unk> and then he had ever comes and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are dying to -- your mouth filled with the bitter become of failure ? ''
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to these questions is : <unk>
yes , i worry about all this thing .
and i had no matter .
and i have a much more things fear that no clue to dignity .
how algae , and other <unk> things .
but when it 's about writing about i think about recently , about and wonder : why ?
it 's reasonable ?
it 's logical that somebody 's supposed to be that they 're afraid , the work to do that he kind of professions , i feel ?

my father , for example , was a chemist and i can look at any situation in his 40 years as a chemist , remember where he was asked whether she scared he had , chemist to be .
with your <unk> , john -- how 're you that ?
it was just not going to you know ?
but to be fair to be -- the group , chemist who have over the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we writer seem but this kind of fame for . but not just the writers , but the creative of genres can seem like this call to have mental , hugely unstable , to be .
everything that to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds from just the 20th century , watch that young and a lot of own hand died .
and even those who do n't actually <unk> <unk> that tracks from their talent that much neglected to be .
norman <unk> said before they died in his last job interview , <unk> of ideas i was a little more <unk>
an extraordinary point that you about her <unk> can do .
but we flashes , not even when we tell anyone should have to tell you hear , because we kind of statements for so long time know , somehow we have the notion of the bones and collective accepted that creativity and suffering , kind of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always wanted to <unk> going .
the question that today i wish everyone here so i want is , is this idea for them all right ?
they feel so i guess ? because with just a piece of the gap at random -- i feel with this perception actually not comfortable .
i think they outrageous .
and i think they dangerous . and i do n't see how it enters the next century was taken into .
i think it better , if we did a lot of creative socializing our lives .
and i know definitely know it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous thing , sort of this dark path of the presumption , sort <unk> -- especially in the situation where i 'm in my career , particularly am .
so -- look : i 'm very young . i 'm just about a 40 years old .
i probably another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that all that 's on i 'm going to write will by the world as the work into is that after <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i 'm going straightforward , because we 're here right now all sort of friends -- it 's highly unlikely that my great success behind me about .
oh , jesus , what an idea !
this is that kind of thinking that someone to get to 9 a.m start to <unk> to drink . and that i do n't .
i would prefer to continue this work do that i love .
so is the question : how ?
eventually , of <unk> i think that i want to continue to write , to make a kind of <unk> psychological construct design must .
somehow i have now find a way to write a safe distance to be true between me and my very natural trepidation about how the response to the writing i will be .
as i was the last year after models to seek out have to doing that , i also in the past seek out and i tried to other societies , and find order to see if you might better or <unk> ideas about it had to us , how creativity can help , with the emotional risks to deal of creativity are connected .
this process took me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please join me , for the circle goes to close .
but in ancient greece and rome with people have n't believe that creativity of people come , okay ?
they believed that creativity is a kind <unk> <unk> , who was from a distant , unknown source to the people coming from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that they 're trying to believe , he said to <unk> , of its wisdom from a more distant was telling .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> .
it 's amazing , the romans did n't really that a genius a particularly <unk> individual was .
they believed that a genius , this magical divine being is that thought was that it literally the walls of <unk> lives -- sort of like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist work with some sense of invisible <unk> and the result of labor is to make it .
it 's brilliant -- you get it , there 's the distance , which i talked about -- the psychological construct that you from the following your work with protecting .
and everybody knew that it 's how did , right ?
the artists of <unk> was a certain things are protected , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?

if your work <unk> -- not entirely what your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius did something <unk> .
so people have the west , really long time about creativity in mind .

it 's the dawn of rational <unk> and people started to think creativity is completely off my own individual coming .
first time in history , to hear people on this , or those artist a genius call -- instead of that he was a genius did .
i need to say , i think it was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of naked person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like this pot , like the pelvis and the essence , the source of divinity , creative , with unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to a <unk> , human psyche <unk> .
it 's like to someone to ask the sun to swallow .
the suggestion and distorted all our egos , and it generates all these inaccessible expectations of the success .
i think that this <unk> our artists of the last 500 years , just rages on top .
and when it is that -- and i think it 's is -- is the question .
we can change ?
maybe a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creativity and return .
maybe not .
maybe we can <unk> from 500 years , rational <unk> not just in a <unk> talk , knock out .
and there are certainly affecting people in this audience who really fair scientific doubt register it 's going on the idea of -- essentially , fairies and people to follow and <unk> on their projects on . work .
i 'll probably not all of them to that voyage to .
but the question that i 've been posing the point is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it 's as much sense like anything , of which i 've heard , when it was that are absolutely crazy <unk> capriciousness of creative process to explain .
a process which is -- like everybody knows that 's ever attempted , something to make -- so in other words , actually anyone here -- not always been properly acts .
in fact that he can look at times , literally <unk> feel .

she said it would like a <unk> move from air ,
through the country on them <unk> would .
they felt when it occurred because it would the dirt beneath her feet to <unk> them .
they knew that it in such as we speak only thing done before . and this was -- in their words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran like a bat for the house while it from this poem that tracked was . they were only about that she quickly enough to a paper and a pencil for movements needed to take it when it through them through <unk> to capture , and on the sheet clinging to .
in other paint it was not fast enough . they ran and hurried and run , but they reached the house , and the poem rolling around them through and you missed it . she said it would continue on land and moving -- how she said -- <unk> another one more dense <unk> .
and then they lost those moments -- that bit i 'll never forget -- they said that there are moments happened in that you think it almost missed .
so , she runs the house and looks after paper and the poem goes through them through and she grabs a pen , right when it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was so like going to the other hand , then pick up and it to grab the wars .

now these opportunities also entered the poem fully functional and intact on paper on -- but backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i heard i thought `` is scary -- this is exactly how my creative process <unk>
it 's nothing like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to me to every day the same time you woke up and sweat to me to struggle and pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i suppose that many of them as it did .
so i had to work or ideas that from a source of me <unk> that i do n't identify it .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step out in relationship with nothing about our wit to lose , but us in fact , even <unk> health to hold ?
for me is the closest living example , how this could do the musician and tom <unk> . i had him a few years for a magazine interview .
we talked about to the subject . and guess what ? most of time life was tom opens the embodiment of that tortured modern , an artist , who was , these <unk> creative impulses that in it lived , to control and with you cope .
but then it became older and quiet . he told me that he was one day on a <unk> in los angeles to this place . and knowing everything changed for him .
he went with high speed as he got a little patch of a melody or hear about the way it up on my inspirations are often is , kind of agonizing intangible , and he wants you have . it 's gorgeous . he <unk> afterwards , but they can do n't grasp .
he has no paper , he did n't make a pen , he did n't <unk> .
he starts to put this ancient trepidation inside of rising , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm from this song on forever followed them .
i 'm not enough , i do it up . ''
but instead of panic of britons , he heard just on .

he looked into the sky and said <unk> , you ca n't see that i car ride ? ''
<unk> i like when i could just a song down ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , if i 'm going to you care for .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole process has then have changed .
not the work itself , which was still a lot of how dark as <unk> and the time .
but the process and the heavy trepidation , that led him around , was salvaged at the genius from out took place where he ran out when anger , caused it and there <unk> where he sort from . he realized that it 's not a skilled workers , tormenting thing would be taken to .
it was a unique being miraculous , bizarre collaboration , put a conversation with tom and the alien , <unk> thing , and not quite tom 's been .
when i hearing that story have changed it a bit of the way that i worked and it i 've ever be saved .
this idea that saved me when i the middle of <unk> of <unk> , ' , <unk> was . i fell into a lot of dug the <unk> in that we all fail if we looked at some work and it does n't . you start to think that it 's a disaster strikes . this is the worst book that ever was written .
not just bad , but the worst ever .
i started thinking , i should the project just <unk> .
but then i remembered that , like tom in the parking heaven you could talk and i tried it .
i took so my view of the manuscript and told my blog commentary towards an empty corner of space .
i talked a loud , `` stop being , you thing , you and i know each , if this book , not brilliant is that 's not entirely on my fault , right ?
because you see that yes , i get everything that i 've invested . i have no longer than that .
if you do it should they 've got to , you must be here show up and your stake , reconsider <unk> .
okay . but if you do n't do -- you know , then the hell out of them .
i 'm still going to write , because it 's my job .
and i would urge to report was giving me to today for my bit of jobs here <unk>
because , the end it 's like . centuries ago , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> of sacred and dance and music spanning the <unk> ceremony has been -- to <unk> .
these strong were getting great because the dancers were a professional and they were fantastic .
but every once , very rare , did something special . one of the performers were actually , transcendent moments .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that they all in your life ever been such an <unk> have seen .
it was like going to the time <unk> and the dancer from a doorway to step . he did n't help but he 's ever did -- a thousand , nights earlier . but it , i put it together .
and lots and suddenly appeared he no longer just in human .
he was from inside , illuminating , from underneath illuminating , and everything is lit up through the divine fire .
as well , then happened , knew that people what it was . they called it by his name .
they put your hands together and began to sing : <unk> , allah , allah , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the <unk> <unk> conquer they took this practice on . the sound reinforcement changed over the centuries of <unk> , allah , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that you still in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if the performers into spain to impossible , something magic did : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , allah , great , <unk> enormously rich , because it is : a transient view of god .
and that 's great because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer and if one wakes up and realize that it 11 o'clock at a tuesday -- is -- and he no longer a <unk> of god in it carries .
he 's just an aging mortal with my aching kneel . and maybe he 'll never return to those high rise .
and perhaps will never any of god 's called `` call when it turns ; but what do it up with the rest of life begin ?
this is hard .
it 's one of <unk> corrections at some creative life .
but maybe it must not so full anguish , if you from the beginning n't believe that have the extraordinary aspects of their existence of them is speaking .
if you might not only believe that you a <unk> are -- by an export source for a <unk> time of life , to somebody else i passed , if you 've done it 's .
if we start , so thinking about changing all this .
so i started to think and i think is certainly in the last couple months , as i was at the book working , which is about appearing is , as the dangerous , scary , powerful as expected <unk> my <unk> success .
what i 'm constantly being should say , if i think about a bug me , is : did n't afraid .
is n't discourages .
i 'll just your job .
was still for your contribution here , whatever it may be .
if your job that dance is , dancing .
when it stupid of god genius , that you present a question is to decide , for a moment a breath by miracles through your efforts to show , then <unk> now ''
and if not , dancing in spite of your dance .
and <unk> now '' for you despite all .
i believe and i feel that we should be teaching .
<unk> now '' for you despite all , just for you to be the mere human love and the <unk> have , it 's got to be .
thanks .
thanks .
<unk> .
last year , i met these slides shown to illustrate that the arctic <unk> that for nearly three million years of the size of the bottom forty-eight states had to 40 percent shrink 's .
but it push it was less powerful enough the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of ice is .
in a sense is the arctic <unk> the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and expanding and the summertime .
the next slide that i 'll show that 's a <unk> what in the last 25 years happened .
this <unk> about red marker .
so you see that dwells in the <unk> tagged , this is the annual ice in winter , and it has been expanding and the summertime .
we called the <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which verbs go from the body here <unk> .
in 25 years time it from here to watch to be gone .
this is a problem , because the warming the frozen reason for the arctic sea <unk> , where it large amounts of <unk> carbon exists , what if he <unk> , of microbes out of methane being implemented it .
compared with the total amount <unk> materials in the atmosphere , they could read this amount of double , if we can see the critical moment cross .
already today <unk> in a flat , lakes in alaska , methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska 's with another group to another one shallow seas last winter , traveled .
wow !
you are okay . the question is how it 's going to anybody .
and one reason is , this enormous reservoir warmed the greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume , you much greater than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know how the ocean by <unk> up here keeps flowing out to sea .
those rivers so rapidly up .
the other end of the planet to antarctica , the biggest <unk> in the planet .
last month , signed researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> has .
and the <unk> that of a couple <unk> show up , is particularly hard to melt .

the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the top of lakes that , a few years of the glaciers were .
forty percent of all people in the world are given half of their <unk> , for that <unk> .
in the andes of these glaciers are <unk> for this town .
the <unk> have <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most drinking <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction of <unk> the sierra seen .
this in terms of the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read books , are seriously .
this <unk> in the world 's going to a dramatic increase of fire .
and the disaster , around the world have in a really <unk> and before we do n't run degree up .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you so the historical terms of looked at , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years we have 70 million tons of co2 produced these 24 hours -- 25 million tons daily in the oceans .
look at the area of eastern pacific in front of the american continent <unk> and directions of indian <unk> where there is a <unk> decline of oxygen in the ocean there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , next to logging that was about 20 percent of mind , that will burn off fossil fuels .

the united states are one of two largest <unk> , with china .
and the proposal was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start to be a change in .
here 's who are in recent years , painted , with some green alternatives , which advocated .
<unk> have a political engagement in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to promote what about it 's a contradiction in it 's .
this picture i remember past things .
for christmas crazy guys , in my home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> out .
so in the <unk> in the news seen .
this is in our nation of <unk> trash in america .
this happened at christmas .
one of ads , the <unk> at christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> happier , <unk> .
it 's going to shell and this wealth in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going every day of clean .
he is affordable eyeglasses and <unk> , and workers are staying in wages , bread .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the <unk> miners is the head of massey coal .
let me a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry reed , they do n't know what they talk .
so , the alliance for <unk> two campaigns in design profession .
this is a , a part of it .
in the <unk> we see <unk> as a serious problem for our business .
so we have to us to the top <unk> trailer , a sizable <unk> spend about a <unk> on the way , into the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not really messy .
we think it 's clean -- and smells , here 's good
so , you make yourself worrying about the <unk> .
let 's what they give us .
<unk> coal , you have a lot of that moment .
so let 's a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal one of <unk> to global warming is that remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
let 's take down in front of this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally get mixed up the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's a crisis in the economy , the national security , preventing .
the red thread , of these all together , is our dependence on <unk> <unk> of dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now have a courageous , new way to us from this <unk> able to dig .
provide america by 100 percent cleaner , electricity new , in the next 10 years
a plan for america went back to work , into us safer and making to help the global warming legislation to stop .
finally , a solution that 's big enough , our to solve problems .
provide america new . you find out again .
this is the last .
it 's a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of old , <unk> <unk> that our world we choke , back down .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment to have paid jobs to make .
provide america new . it 's time , reality to accept .
it 's an old <unk> saying `` if you very easy to be wanting to go alone .
if you far come want to go together . ''
we have far come , which was quickly .
thanks .
i want to begin with them to ask , of the time your childhood <unk> when you with <unk> played .

the spatial can think is intimately that connect with how we a lot of our environment understand .
when <unk> -- inspired by the kind of our minds interacting with physical objects -- up with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague <unk> <unk> , i began to wonder : what if we use computers would that instead of <unk> , who was like a digital <unk> on a flat canvas , it moves , what if we with both hands to intervene could and data , physically capture and you arrange them might say what we want it ?
this question was so intense that we wanted to explore the answer i decided , and <unk> developed .
short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in size of <unk> .
you can by hand be moved , they can be one another experience , you can do its motion capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , are are physically , so you how to convert them through the letting the hands and minds can move .
and the <unk> are an example of new generation of <unk> the manipulation of digital data .

i start with some simply begin .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in one direction <unk> , is the video forward playing , when i it in the opposite direction <unk> continuing to it backwards .
and this interactive portraits take each case .
if i so next to 'm going to lights the your interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , they find these , and make a little nervous .
and you feel as their movements and slope .
an interesting result of interactions , we have to know , started was that we everyday gestures on data use could such as color so for dumping how to this with <unk> does .
in this case we three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them to paint in the in the middle to pour it where they then mixed up .
if we might overdo it , we can get a little <unk> .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as talking about , mathematics or <unk> , where people the possibility of fast <unk> bit and the data and immediately to watch .
i 'm here -- that 's a <unk> that i have a simple <unk> design .
this is playing with words , this kind of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> is .

then , in about 30 seconds , will get mixed and you have a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thanks .
these are some kids are on a trip to the media lab came . i could get you , it to try and have a video game of the camera .
so in the really loved .
some interesting way to this kind of applications is that you to people not many instructions must be .
all you should say , `` is words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here we have a few people who it works .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turns out that he was the <unk> just pile them wanted .
so for him were all you convert .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted a powerful for <unk> develop .

he can create new characters in the scene bring to work by the <unk> the table , lifts that this figure out .
so let 's the sun rise .
the sun goes on
now go find a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah .
by the <unk> shake and you next to put it could , the characters would interact as well ...
-- his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide what they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example , for today i 've got there to show that 's a <unk> for <unk> that recently we 've developed and in the <unk> as sound like to <unk> being basses and drums imagery .
each has four different variations on ; you can choose which you use want .
and you can these sounds in the sequence <unk> that you turn into any patterns can arrange them .
and you <unk> you a , by just a <unk> to a <unk> happen .
there are effects that you live can change , like . hall and filter .
you hook it with a particular sound and may be kept going to hire .
and then pretty much larger effects of the speed and volume , that you on the entire sequence , exercise .
so let 's time .
we start , where we were the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and it in a series mandate , they expand and a bit more the voice also .
now i add a bass sticker .
this is me another thing drums to do .
and now i plug i the filter into the drums , so i the effect that live of navigating it .
i can look at the entire sequence , accelerating , i make the rate in one or the other direction <unk> .
and now i plug and those filters were going on the bass lessons -- for something more points .
i can the sequence , while you 're going change .
so i have n't you in <unk> planning , it 's able to improvise , you during this vector , or time .
and finally , i get the entire sequence ignore , i make the <unk> left tend to .
thanks .
so as you can see , is my passion of course , new <unk> to develop , the better to adjust how our brains and body work .
and today i had time , you some of that new <unk> and some of possibilities of a look what we in our lab at work .
the idea that i have them on the way to give you want is that we on the cusp of this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media gets out of information , in our world put that our needs of tweets .
thanks .
i 'm on the conversation with you all .
