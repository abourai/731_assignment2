when steve lopez , tech columnist of los angeles times , one day through the streets of the center of los angeles went , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man : an african-american , likable , rough , homeless , the on a violin have played that have only two strings had .
many of you are the story of know , because of <unk> paper was later a book that again a movie , by robert downey junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> who on <unk> studied and its very promising career tragically early by their paranoid schizophrenia ended up .
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years lived there it as homeless woman on the streets of <unk> <unk> the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or at the film to see , lest you just the wonderful connected to understand that between these two men evolved is , but what the music that link to make helping and how they finally the instrument came when the pun allows is that 's <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , well two years , from walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of <unk> first and fourth symphony heard and got behind the stage to me introduce you .
he did n't have a very <unk> and <unk> tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers abandoned it never come into a baseball world series of creating . and if it all over that <unk> passage of our first violin at last sentence by <unk> fourth symphony .



and in just as a <unk> found itself nathaniel when we with our first class in the walt disney <unk> hall started . he had these mind-boggling flickering in their eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how it does anyone in my sleep , toxins wanted .
i feared , not <unk> , but i feared that i would actually lose that it into an artist 's heightened immersed could and that i got its relationship to violin have the destruction would be when i started just about <unk> and <unk> and more glamorous forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
so i just to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and as i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes a <unk> change was wrong .
it was , as if it under the impact an invisible medicine of it said , a chemical response , of the catalyst my game was .
<unk> <unk> anger morphed into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and how by a miracle , he took his violin and started to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , them out to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started going on a lot about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other b , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that they 're not just an encyclopedic know about music owned , but it with you also a strong personal relationship combined .
he talked about her with a passion and if you understand that i see only from my colleagues at philharmonic of los angeles know .
by strapping on music playing and about music interviewed was from this <unk> , confused man who wo n't all around the streets of los angeles pulled that was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> music today .
music 's medicine . music is transforming ourselves .
for nathaniel means music involves health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in a real to transform .
and so <unk> his agonized situation .
i realized that that 's what the nature of art is .
right here is the reason that we music making : so we something that in all of us , deep inside out of our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually shape can .
and the fact that expression hit us all , and moved to inspire and it unites us .
what nathaniel terms , it took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family of musicians that he understood that would be a talent to recognize him and <unk> .
and i 'll keep on with nathaniel music , whether to walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> <unk> , because he reminds me why i musicians and i reply .
thanks .
bruno giussani : thanks . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play that i <unk> the <unk> stolen to this .
i hope , they excuse me .
so i have in my life , many fish have argued .
i 've only two loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate fling with .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> good , consistency , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .

you could be so comfortable with me feel , it to sell it .
i had this beauty is a sense for several months .
one day , i call the head of your business , he said , if i was in an event and recite could about sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
there was a company that to solve was trying to what this tremendous problem for us chefs 's becoming . how to keep that we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years we have the sea fish out how we forests <unk> beaten up .
it 's hard , the destruction of <unk> .
ninety percent of the big fish , of that we love , creating tuna that <unk> that salmon , this swordfish . they are breaking .
it 's almost nothing left .
so it will probably disney or bad <unk> , <unk> , in our future will be .
many arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , so for tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
so , 15 pounds <unk> are required to have a pound <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
tastes not very good .
so here was finally one company that , attempted it right to make .
i did they supported .
a day before the event i called the head of <unk> for the company in .
we call him , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` just about the fact , to really have , you are famous for this , so far out in the sea grow , you for the environment is not really polluted . ''
`` that basis , '' he said , `` we are so far out that 's waste from a fish and distributed , is n't focused . ''
and then put it 's attach , `` we 're essentially a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to 1 , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one thing ? what feeding her ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and that night i was in bed thinking : what hell 's a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don on .
i said , don what for example are sustainable proteins that ? ''
he said , he knows that not . he 'll responds .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could be a proper answers to that . until i finally begin with senior biologists <unk> .
we call him as well , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` what for example are sustainable proteins that ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , <unk> ? ''
he said `` yes , putting feathers of skin , <unk> , residue , <unk> and to cook food processing . ''
i said `` what percentage <unk> <unk> 's chicken of ?
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .

there was a long break in the vocals and he said , there are just too much chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me of this fish .
no , not because i have a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> actually from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish with this conversation about it 's chicken <unk> has .
that second dog that 's another kind of <unk> .
it is romantic sort of the way , where you get to the better your fish about learning , you the fish the more love .
i have to the first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
one of our journalist , i had been thinking about this fish , talking about .
she 's kind reverse-engineering this .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef came up with him <unk> .
hs twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't , but this guy is it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he miguel sokoloff .
and no , he 's the fish to cook and he 's not a chef . least it 's the way that , and i 'd have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it 's near the <unk> of flow <unk> .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on , which basically wetlands have been .
they did this , by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated series of the canals , and they had urged her water from the land out and it out to the river .
now , they could n't do that the work , not economic .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds walk around , what a place many birds are .
and so , 1982 a spanish company with green is bought that land .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of water in reverse .
they have literally to lever thrown away .
instead of the water <unk> they brought the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created an 11,000 acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company which begets environmental destruction is completely subverted .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you have something like never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , of a million miles away , and everything you 're seeing <unk> channels and the density , lush march .
i was there was n't long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin , one part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? because we were and struggle to us by the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been rolled up to my knees , and miguel , holding in peace one <unk> .
this removes a rare <unk> out .
so i mentioned , it <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of pool that it on the tanzanian giraffe mind .
it turns out that miguel most of his career in <unk> <unk> in africa has spent .
i asked him , going to as a <unk> 's becoming .
he said , fish ? i know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert in relationship . ''
and then he goes and fall into more hearing about the rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and now do n't see me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know that <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was sick to think about that <unk> piece of delicious fish that i feel the brink had .
so i it stopped . i said : miguel , how come to your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the connections that 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
what 's the <unk> ? ''
now , he goes on me to tell you know it was such a aspirate system is that the fish to eat what you in the wild food would .
the <unk> biomass of phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish to baseball .
the system is as good , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
depending upon a farm is a lot of your animal to stop feeding ?
after day i went on this site of it is miguel around and i asked him , i said , for a place that 's kind of course it seems to be , unlike each farm in which i ever been to , `` how to measure of you 'll succeed ? ''
the moment , it 's like a <unk> a <unk> requires you know .
and we came around the corner and we provided the <unk> sight of thousands and thousands , pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet that far the eye .
`` it 's success , '' he said .
`` check out their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said : miguel , <unk> they do n't find your fish ? ''
`` yes , he said .
`` we lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year went on this site 600,000 birds , more than 100 different ways .
it 's now the largest and one of the main private <unk> across europe , today .
i said : miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing you on a <unk> have want ? ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , we build <unk> , not hard .
this is an organic network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
je pinker 's so the belly down the better the system . ''
okay , let 's going to revisit . a farm , the ones stop feeding and a farm that their success on the health of its predators measures .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos covered by <unk> n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the surface is better for the nest maintenance .
every morning they go 240 the mile farm .
and every night fly it comes 240 miles away .
they do because it 's <unk> white line the highway <unk> may follow .
seriously .
i had a journey of penguins had imagined , so i went miguel on .
i said : miguel , they go 240 miles to the farm and they go up 240 miles back at night ?
they do for kids ? ''
he looked at me as if i just a song from the whitney houston quoted .
he said `` no . they do this because the food is better . ''
i have n't the skin of my beloved of a fish mentioned , the most delicious , and i may not <unk> . i do n't like them <unk> . i might not be crisp .
it is that <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i cooking almost never struck it .
and yet , when i gave them in this restaurant in <unk> try 've got it 's not to <unk> <unk> .
she liked the sweet and in , as if you a half bites by the ocean would take .
i mentioned the face miguel , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a sponge .
she 's the last defenses , until something in the body happens .
it has progressed throughout the evolution has decided to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then put it in addition , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm that your fish to stop feeding . a farm that their success then measure the success of its predators .
and then i recognized when he says , a farm that had no <unk> , <unk> he powerful , because the water , it through this farm flows comes from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , of all the things with it does that are rivers so now tend to take to lead , chemical pollutants , runoff from <unk> .
and if it spreads by the system , fought , and this leaves is the waters clean up , how it <unk> is .
the system is as good , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the animals that , it feeds , not just a farm that their success on the health of its predators measures , but a farm that literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i took him , and that they should be doing , because these <unk> what romantic whatever , is also telling .
you might argue that you a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what do we need is a radical new conception of agriculture , from one , in the foods really good taste .
but for many people 's a little bit more radical .
we 're not a realist novel , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat the organic .
and if you say , the things have to leave the future of good food can assure you can somebody somewhere and say `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
i must be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not because we have enough calories are producing to the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- because <unk> disparities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not because it 's the logic of <unk> the last 50 years of defined by .
feed the grain of the herbivores to <unk> of <unk> , chemicals on the planet for chicken at the fishes , and this stuff has to agribusiness just wondered : `` if we more people less feed , how awful it will be ? ''
this was the motivation . it was the best justification and it was the business plan the american agriculture .
we should call them , what it 's a craft in <unk> , a craft that 's very organic capital eats , the fact , the production take place .
this is not a craft , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> is today face , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but with fertile country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not tainted with chainsaws , but with forests , and not across boats , and nets , but with fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we feed itself ?
or better , how do we conditions do that every community , enabling to herself to feed ?
in order to do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at <unk> and it has ever really good for food produced .
we go instead of the green model of .
this is that in two billion years of employment <unk> .
look miguel , farmers how miguel ,
businesses , which is n't worlds for themselves are , factories that restore instead <unk> , factories , the <unk> growing evidence and just hard to farmers that not just emitters , but are experts on relationships ,
because they are ones that 's expert in flavor is .
and if i really honestly 'm sure you 're a better , chef : when i possibly be with me .
you know that 's my right , because if that the future of good food is , it is delicious be .
thanks .
if i give you about one thing they perceive want it is that the totality of data that we consume that 's bigger than the sum of the parts and instead i appeal to <unk> to think i want that you think about how we information that can use that pattern appear and we have these trends could recognize that otherwise , not visible got together .
so what we see here 's a typical <unk> to age arranged .
the program that i 'm running here is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i 'm going to <unk> can do is that i want to a certain death filter that can tell us an accident .
and immediately , i see another pattern , which emerge .
in fact , because in <unk> here the people on the most are and they over here at <unk> are .
we can one more step out and sort of the data , then again and see that <unk> and cancer the usual suspects , but not for everyone .

and who <unk> see that this is especially in men is true .
you see so that the reputation of information and data in this sort of swimming in a living <unk> mind .
and if we 're concerned this <unk> can do why not for the content matters ?

it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
you can do n't like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can actually attached to a certain copy to jump .
now if i look over here , i see the athlete that in this issue that appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , i click this way that criminalize me all expenses show you have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , if i just a <unk> track get me , i might think `` okay , what if i 'm going to the subject i 'm cycling societies ? ''
so i step back and <unk> of view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and you get an idea of that if you like this information scans , specifically , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , looking at it or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually slightly different is .
it 's something between them and we think it changes the way and what information can be used .
i want this idea now a little more do with about what a little crazy is .
what we 've done is , we have any one <unk> plate and it on a little summary , reduced .
the summary , contains a quick view and a symbol of the domain of which you come .

but even in unconstrained view helps us a lot of things .

i 'll discuss this topic <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' voted for i know that the <unk> looking at the most likely to be repaid in time out <unk> `` people of the year . '' there are .
this is really important , because it had a realization that 's not in a single <unk> out .
this is just to see if you step back and the whole issue .

now if i all these people think i know that the majority of <unk> are . some come from science . some , less again , come from the economy . here is my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono 's a ted prize winner .
so we can now i jumped , and a look at all the ted prize winner throw away .
you see , we are surfing on the web the first time it may actually have a net , is not just by side to page , but more abstract .
and so let me show what else to show what a little surprise to be .
i show here just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want it 's not a browser call ; it 's really need any browser , but you can websites to look closely -- and we make these <unk> to each individual site like this .
so i can step back -- and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
this is so important because you just by the look at websites are in that way , all the <unk> in the same way they could actually .
so i can in my trajectory zoom in a specific <unk> .
here is the state of all of the demonstration , which i have to go and 've given .
and i can sort everything that today i had been considered to have , again <unk> .
and when i came back step away and everything to look , i can see my trajectory in new order maybe for my <unk> . here , i decided to <unk> ' searching , here , bing ; you here to live labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the end to go and they will inflict that .
it 's a metaphor that keeps it 's used , and every time it does this picture bigger than the sum of <unk> .
now , in this world , we think that data is a curse those who are .
we 're talking about curse of <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation to turn could and the internet on the upside down , so that we instead of getting from the second thing to go to start by many things too many things go to do , and as a pattern that otherwise , unseen remained , be ?
if we do that can , then this exceeds <unk> , maybe a new source more sense of information .
and , instead of just in information to move to do we know it to get .
and if we know , you know , then we can maybe their wisdom and try and move .
so i hear on , very much .
i grew with a <unk> helping science fiction , right .
in my school got off with the bus an education , every day an hour route .

these curious turns out of course , that i always , when i 'm not in school , through the forests <unk> , and went `` samples '' which collected , frogs and snakes and he heads and <unk> , all of bringing it home and under the microscope kind .
i was completely <unk> , you know .


jacques cousteau came to our living rooms with his amazing event that we animals and places and a world full of wonders they showed that we 'd never had to imagine .
so that there goes quite well in those <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .

that we had at all . if we as kids a book read , we took the description of the author and projected needs them at the screen in our minds .
my response was the drawing and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts , and so what .

the creativity has to wait a way out .
and what happened is something interesting . what i 'm going to jacques <unk> shows that fascinated that was the idea of us completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly going out , i never an alien world with a spacecraft that point . it seemed very likely .
but there was a world that i actually ever been able to here on earth , and she was also fascinating and exotic as all the what i always had imagined when i found those books had read .
so i decided when i was 15 to bounce back to be .
the only problem here was that i 'm going to a small village in canada lived , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean from .
that i let me , but not going to discourage .
i <unk> my father , until he finally one <unk> in <unk> , new york , down 've done , right on the other side of the threshold where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> the middle of winter winds in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real creatures , i got only two years later to face where we had to california moved .
since , in the 40 years , the meantime <unk> are , i spent about three thousand hours in water spent . 300 hours at them <unk> .
and i learned that the world the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich with <unk> life is how we really hard to imagine .
to imagination of nature knows the limit , naturally as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
by the present day i am deepest awe of what i look at my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean , holding on , the same intensity as <unk> and the time .
and when i then grown a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
this seemed the best way of my inner drive , stories to tell , with my need to reconcile to create , to unite .
when he drew me constantly <unk> and so .
so these films in the way of images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
clearly were the stories that i <unk> , from <unk> `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , `` <unk> . ''
of the `` <unk> '' i could my penchant for the <unk> and that come with <unk> space .
so intertwined when we kind of my two passions .
something interesting happened to `` <unk> '' : for a <unk> problem in this video to solve -- and that we had such a kind of liquid <unk> create -- that we took on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what turned out , was the first <unk> <unk> that 's ever in a film to see it was .

according to arthur clarke 's law 's traditionally <unk> technology and the rocket all right off to tell .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found is terribly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , this must have done in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went into the terminator or two , '' my next movie , even more on .
with <unk> created we visited the guy from liquid metal . the success was completely off , like this effect basic dignity .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same , but we embarked on the film is a bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences and based , was a whole new world a lot of a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i started a company , up with my good friend stan winston studio , the in the time the best <unk> and <unk> was . they called `` the digital <unk> . ''

we did actually , and lead us as a while a <unk> .
but the middle of the 1990s years we realized something that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started worrying about -- too slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` avatar , '' written that the <unk> of an visual effects and <unk> effects in the whole new heights push against , with lifelike human , expressive characters , that allows <unk> been produced was . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world would <unk> be .
but the <unk> put quite happened . and people in my company , said that we temporary n't been able to be that to make .
so shifted to taking those other film about the big ship , the fall .
the <unk> i 'm going to `` romeo and juliet is on a ship everything else sells . it was a <unk> epic <unk> , a passionate film .
secretly , but i was actually going to the real wreck the titanic <unk> .
so i the film did .
this is the truth . the studio knew that is not .
i draw you believe that by i said , we try to the wreckage . we film at the real wreck .
we 're actually in the <unk> the film shows .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to settle .
crazy . but that goes back to look again , that your imagination a reality rendering it .

this was no movie , no <unk> , that was really .

and the level there were huge ; we 'd have cameras and light and all sorts of building .
and i noticed at how much of these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
it gets into the capsule , floating in this dark , hostile environment just down , where no hope for saving enough , when you do n't even back to do .
and i said , `` wow , that 's also , being in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed by studying the deep .
anyway by the part of the with curiosity and science has to do . it was all . it was exploring , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i hollywood 's not be able to .

in some of the following expeditions i beings in <unk> seen , and sometimes the things that i never seen before had , sometimes even things that ever yet nobody ever seen before had and for the science is the moment when we saw her , still no words had found .
it made me now really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i met then one thing that particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i want my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood to ice will put them and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we dropped to the bismarck , '' and i explored in them <unk> .
we returned to train wreck the titanic back .
we took a little robots that we built were out a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and look inside the ship to see what ever done has been .
nobody had ever inside the <unk> explored . they were still no resources in favor . so we evolved to build a technology .
well , and there , i 'm now , on the deck of titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that these <unk> here 's very similar , and which i know that once the band performed there 's .
and i am a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm going shopping it 's actually just , but my consciousness is within the car .
it felt that looks like i physically in the <unk> the titanic here .

this set of this is an exact replica of <unk> the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
they made me this <unk> know that if you have such <unk> avatars and work as your consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence embarrassed you .
it was really quite profound
and maybe even a little out toward the thing that maybe in a few decades can happen , if you <unk> has to look at or other things to do , in all sorts <unk> <unk> , that i was as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we started what we down there 'd seen , really appreciate to learn , like this <unk> where we these incredible amazing animals saw . that 's kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with some sort of chemosynthesis .
it exists not in a lot of sunlight based system , how we do .
and so you see animals , the next to a $ 300 degrees centigrade , we call them to survive there can .
the same time that interested in which i also very for <unk> , that was the <unk> from my childhood .
and so the plane i with people who , for space that interest and with the nasa , about and in <unk> and sitting right <unk> planning -- they travel through russia , through the mission that <unk> protocol , branching systems all right and turn to fly up to international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but ultimately , it was point that i <unk> with us in the deepest took .
i took them with and <unk> you access to the world upside down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who , for such extreme conditions interesting . i took them to the vents at , so you will lay sample , take and instruments , test could and so forth .
we turned out documentaries of powered but the science , specifically , <unk> .
so lock into the circle anywhere from my existence as <unk> , then a kid , and the execution in the reality .
throughout this <unk> i 've learned a lot .
i got a lot of science and learn . but now i think they certainly , a director does it can lead to a guide to be like a <unk> or something .
i did n't make lots of leadership , before i those of expeditions <unk> .
because at some point i had to tell me , `` what i 'm actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out ? ''
these stinking movies are bringing us no money on .
we play time on the <unk> a . of fame was not a trail .
all think that i was between `` titanic '' and `` avatar . <unk> and i 'd let me some level of nails on one towel the beach tweaked her .
i 've all those movies , the documentaries for a very small audience did .
not a fame , no pleasure , no money . how do you just ?
you do about the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there are . you do the <unk> because , and because of funny connection that occurs when a small group of people a team , it forms .
because we 've all this with only 10 or 12 people did , the years , broadcasting worked out . sometimes we were two or three months in a row at sea .
and in this community , you realize that the main thing is becoming aware is that we 're going to each other words , because you a task <unk> , that you any other that can explain .
if you on land back and saying , we had to do , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and that all around , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human capability , if you look at sea works , '' then you can see the other just not explain . that 's the police or with soldiers that something together through , and we know that they never hear somebody can explain .

so when i came to my next movie `` the avatar , '' to turn , i tried to the same leadership apply that is that you his team of respect and in return of that , culturally recognized .
it was the dynamics really changed .
i stood there so again with a small team up with unknown <unk> . we turned on , the avatar , '' with a new technique that it previously had never happened .
immensely exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we went for a period of a half years to a real family .
it changed my kind of movies , doing up .
there were people who said , we would these <unk> do n't really good <unk> and on planets pandora transport .
for me it was more a <unk> kind of my job to do the actual process which is a result has changed .
what we can sort of all this to finish ?
some lessons we 've learned ?
i believe that number one is the curiosity .
it 's the <unk> human feature .
our imagination is a power that even a reality rendering it .
and the aware of your team is important than all <unk> this world .
come to me kid filmmaker , which says , `` give me some advice , as i do that can . ''
and i say `` <unk> do n't even a .
it 'll get on others to you . do n't get yourself to bet , not for themselves . but take risks for you . ''
so nasa has managed to <unk> `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in art and while researching to fail an alternative to be , because there guarantee it a <unk> .
no big endeavor , which innovation insisted that was ever done without risk of being addressed .
you must be willing to build those risks on to take .
it 's the idea that i think you want to focus on the way to give you . failure is quite an alternative , fear and is no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised maybe something , because my <unk> at the foundations are mainly about vaccines , and seed is to the things that we create and deliver have to the poorest two billion a better life to reach .
but energy and climate is incredibly important for those people , if we 're even more than anyone else in the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow . it 's too much or good enough to rain . the things going to come out change how it their fragile environment , possibly could bear .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a <unk> bad for you see them .
secondly , the <unk> for you very important .
in fact that when you can only one thing the price down to be able to be <unk> if energy by far the <unk> .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> pushing the industrial revolution in and even at the 20th century , they saw a <unk> case in <unk> and so we have refrigerators -- <unk> , we can modern materials for manufacture and so many things .
we 're so in a wonderful point using electricity in the wealthy world .
but if it 's the price down -- we let us the prize a half -- we make a new boom and this barrier in hiv/aids co2 down .
co2 warmed the planet and the equation for carbon is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which is to <unk> lead and this <unk> has some pretty negative effects . effects on the weather and maybe terrible thing that indirect result that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not able to fit and sort of the whole systems <unk> .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the it was resulting <unk> and where are very unexpected consequences are , there 's some grapple with , but not very much .
and there are safe obscurity about how bad those consequences will . but they 're incredibly severe head .
i have the <unk> times say , `` we really have down to near zero to come ?
not enough to the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we are near zero , is the temperature on rising .
so it’s a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have 3.5 feet high truck , the under a $ 3 feet bridge from each other . you can then put them up and squash it .
so this must be further down , to zero .

every american about 20 tons . people from the poor countries , less than one .
on average is about five billion tons for everyone in the planet .
and somehow we have to change evoking the to zero down .
it 's been decrease up .
just different economic transformations are about it impacts and we have a lot of <unk> rise of reduction and go to a reduction in america to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little multiplication -- you have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that it towards zero to make people want and that by the number of people around , of the service that every man on average , uses of average energy for any service and to carbon that per unit <unk> will .
let 's so every single factor of individually and look at think we , how we got to zero to get .
probably have a those numbers very close to zero from .
now this is the basic algebra , but let 's about it through .
first we the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is happening at 9 billion over to . the controversies at 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> are we could do n't think about 10 percent or 15 percent down , but right now let 's a slope to 1.3 .
the second thing is the services , that we use .
that includes all , the food that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> means , those services , almost any of the planet open to .
it 's great that this number drops .
in the wealthy world , in the top billion , we could possibly stain me make and less value , but on average is that number of every year are growing up and so collectively , more than double , the number of services the per person delivered to be .
here 's a very basic service . there at home light to have the homework can read ?
and those students did n't , so they go out and reading your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , i finally good news .
we have something that 's not up ,
because of different successes in <unk> , from other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there are many services -- which is pretty some of those services , let 's characterized by 90 percent decrease .
in other service , like the manufacture of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement very much lower .
there , if we optimistic is , we have perhaps a reduction in a factor for three or maybe for a factor of six .
but with the first three factors , we 're going to form of 26 billion dollars on it might <unk> 13 billion tons commercializing , and that comes not going out !
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a key to be -- this is the amount of co2 as per unit <unk> will .
it turns out the question , if you that to zero to get .
if you coal burn : no .
if you gas burn : no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables and rocketry passion .
so what we on a global level need to do is a new system to make .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders of a feature , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
people here have to the creation of a lot of the miracle that contributed .
normally do n't a deadline of having a miracle to a certain date needs .
usually if you basically just wrong and there are going to others not .
in this case , we need but floor to give and a miracle in very long time .
now , i wondered how should i really <unk> ?
they have a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the idea of people here passionate ?
i remembered looking at last year , when i mosquitos , brought and somehow i liked the people it .
the idea was for you very palpable , you know that we have the people who speaks to mosquitos life .
for energy i noticed this one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to environment that would be here .
here are so some natural fireflies .
it has told me that they do n't bite . actually you will probably wo n't even the glass , abandoned .
now , there are all sorts <unk> like this , but they bring everybody 's not much .
we need to find solutions , either one or any number of a tremendous scaling up and how incredible dependability . there and while it many ways is where people seem to look , i do see just five that these big demands is capable .
i tides , <unk> , merger and use biofuels , playful .
they do is perhaps the moderates contributions and if you better to do when i expect , that would love , but my statement is that we could take all those five to work and we ca n't of them up , because they were approached it , because all have significant problems .
we look at first of the burning fossil fuels , start burning of either coal or gas .
what you get there 's going to think maybe just , but this is n't know . you 'd all the co2 that after the burn off the <unk> comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then kind of storage and hope that there 's left .

if you 're going to make sure ?
who can be not guarantee , which literally a billion times bigger than any kind of waste to recover from <unk> and other things can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough <unk> .
now , `` my rocketry passion .
they also has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question for certainty that you really feel that nothing wrong can go , despite the human and abilities that the fuel not for weapons 's used .
and what makes you 're going to the garbage ?
because although he does n't 's very large , they have a lot of concerns .
so three very thorny problems that might even soluble , and where you so my work should .
the last three of five , i 've summarized .
there are those renewables , how they often be called .
they also have -- although it is great , you to make any fuel needs -- you have some downsides .
one is the <unk> that these technologies create dramatic less than the of <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk of many miles , <unk> more land than a normal power .

the sun shines not all day , it seems to choose not every day and just blows with the wind carries no time .
so we need to get from these vents 's dependent on , a way , the energy in times when they did n't available , is the elevator .
there are so large <unk> . there are challenges of transmission . if we already saying that the power outside the country is , you do n't just the technology , they do need to the risk around that the energy from where different heritage .
and there are the <unk> .
and about dimension to show , i 've all kinds of batteries , who are made , looking at the to cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and i did with the amount of electronic energy , which the world 's using , compared . i found that all my batteries , which now we produce , less than 10 minutes of <unk> camps now .
we need 's a big advancement , something that around a factor of 100 be better than is , when the approaches , right now .
this is not impossible , but it 's not easy .
this happens when you try and this <unk> sources of what would say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of bringing them .
if you hear about 100 percent to sustain want , you do an incredible <unk> .
now , where do we go , what 's the right approach ?
one of manhattan project , '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies that working . hundreds .
in each of these five areas where we need least 100 people .
so thank you 'll say that are crazy ! it 's good .
i think there in the ted community are many of activities , there are engaged .
bill big has several different companies , including a name of <unk> the great <unk> has .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of business were great things do and interesting ways , and i 'm going to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay a company that , may surprise , the nuclear way around .


this <unk> means that you rather than one part of <unk> , the one percent of the <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent of burning , the <unk> .
it 's quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you have already been thinking , but you could never reasonable simulate -- whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputer to have to do you simulate fog and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent is burning , is the <unk> very much better .
actually burning you the garbage , and you can even the waste of today reactors operate as <unk> use .
instead of about the head to break they burn it easy . a great thing .
this uranium is called incremental uses , a bit like a candle .
you see that 's a column , is often calls `` a traveling wave of reactors . labeled here .
that solves really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part of today , burn it , <unk> so it says <unk> uranium .
the boxes the u.s. for hundreds of years on .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get plenty of fuel for the rest of the lifetimes of the planet .
you know , there are still having many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
and think we , how to our success rate about .
what should we had a testament to be ?
now , we go up to target that we need to reach and then talk about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it 's really important that we go get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement known to clean his .
so to prove that 80 percent to do have to the <unk> , including countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note she says , whether we have the <unk> technology using it , if you in all the developed countries used is and we on the way , you to the rest of the elevator .
that 's great deal .
this is one key that <unk> .
if we from there back -- how should those 2020 testament to be ?
it should come back the two elements of contain .
we should the <unk> , use to reduce the way to gain , less money we <unk> , the lower than is the <unk> be , and also the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things we do that does n't fully to the big <unk> is take all right , or even slightly less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for this breakthroughs itself .
this breakthroughs , we need to floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great ideas about this topic .

and you are actually going through and create a framework where this wide talk to basically , because we need to support of all sides .
there are things that come together to .
this is a request .
a very <unk> wish that we this technology to invent .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years to allow that i could the president to choose , a vaccine for years and i love , or i could this desire to choose who is , <unk> <unk> without adding co2 being invented in this wish i would take me .
this has the biggest impact .

what we have so i do ?
for which measures <unk> me ?
we 're for more funding to use .
if countries in places like <unk> make , they should not only about carbon to talk .
they should those <unk> talking and they were shocked by the silly little money that for that cutting-edge approaches to spend them .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> do .
we need to spread the message .
we 've taken off dialogue rational and <unk> lead and also the things that from the government be done .
it 's an important wish , but i think we can see him meet .
thanks .
thanks .
thanks . thanks !
thanks . just to <unk> something better to understand -- first place , you can take an idea of scale that investment be ?
bill gates : to the simulation in a supercomputer to conduct , all the great scientist to get what we did we need to just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian reactor was tested have to ensure that it properly works , one is just in the <unk> million .
the tough to step is the building in the first <unk> , another billion to find that <unk> and the place in fact , the first of building .
once the first is finished , if it that 's as i promised , it 's clearly , because the economics , the <unk> 's not like rocketry that we know it .

bg : yeah . now you have the reactor ever seen <unk> , so there are many people and lots of monitoring that go wrong can . this thing where you get it opens and stuff come to cause . that 's not good .
but if you very cheap fuel , you can kind of 60 years <unk> -- think about a column , they bury them , without the <unk> .
and it sits there and burns : 60 years and then it 's done .
a <unk> who are a solution to the garbage is offering .
bg : yeah . so what do with junk that happens : you can see him sitting in real time -- there are much less junk shot with this method -- then take them , and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by the garbage can take that has already exists , the rule in <unk> or <unk> of reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so this is what we give these reactors run a problem was , what we in our fill and so that will <unk> dramatically reduce in that process .
but while you with multiple people that world of these opportunities 've talked ,
where is the main interest , so what actually implement ?
bg : so we 've never existed on a place organized and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there are passion and people are the company was in russia , india , china is , i was here and have the energy met and talked about how it 's going to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the way home .
this is a nuance of thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have this building , that is anyone who 's a whirlwind reactor was implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and more likely to this really in to call ?
bg : so we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that we 're very affordable , we secured 20 years to create and then 20 years to use .
this is like the deadline , giving us the <unk> has illustrated that we <unk> need .
and , you know , <unk> , if all good racing , and this is a big wish , this could easily , often .
and fortunately it 's dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of those who likewise , if those approaches worked , the funding for its operator to work , for <unk> can .
and it was best when it 's a couple of creating , because then you could a mixture use .
certainly we need a solution .

bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it would n't even without the <unk> been , but the power that there are so much more .
the nuclear sector has some innovative companies .
you know , we know their work not just about this , but there are modular way that 's a different approach .

and so there are many things , but this nice thing is that a <unk> a million times as much energy has the way , say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems lies can and they are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in your own league .
if it does n't , what ?
we have to <unk> come to try to the rise robust to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation , does it 's like when you ate too much , and shortly before a <unk> you can . what makes you have happened ? you know , maybe a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> the <unk> calls that are doing with various techniques trying to the warming to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer be having to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you pray that we do n't need .
some people say , you should not only on the cover designs because one that might be lazy you do so you go eat , because you know that one of the <unk> save it .
i do n't know if this smart , if you look at the importance of this problem looking at leads , but there are now of the social discourse in <unk> about whether it available to have , if the things faster , or this innovation longer need to when we expect .
<unk> : you have one or two lines for the to you may be able to convince them ?
bg : well , it’s real life , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
those of the underpinning the case , at that are very little .
they say that there are negative effect is that with the clouds to do , things are shifting ?
there are very , very few things that they 've ever be able to ask , which have an opportunity in a million there .
this <unk> here 's like with aids .
you make the mistake now , and you work pays very much later .
and so is the idea , now , if you all sorts <unk> is struggling with something to invest , one of you will actually what happened -- and there 's that the investment not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst possibility and there are people in the wealthy world , on the ipcc are really look and say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact that this uncertainty us should worry .
but my dream is that , you had the economic can do , and , at the carbon over , then also say the skeptics , `` okay , there are interested in i do n't know it was no carbon <unk> , i wish provides nearly there is the bad , but i shall not accept that because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you all this time and energy use to the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals suffer , the <unk> who confront of malaria and so on that it 's a stupid waste of resources , is money to invest , as it better give things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending to research -- let 's the u.s. government should be 10 billion per year , spend when they do today -- that 's not quite dramatic .
one thing the other things not suffer .
you come up to big <unk> , and here we can bring sensible people disagree about when you have something that was not economic inequality , and you 're trying to fund . for me that 's happening here most of waste .
unless there , it 's very shortly before a <unk> and funded the only have the <unk> . i think we need more things are trying to the potential , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> that you get , a very high <unk> , it can only the rich stay .
i mean , all of us here could five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a calamity .
and even <unk> think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research is not talking about ? ''
he 's still , because its former stories , with <unk> associated , but he understood that 's a very lonely group is and so he will now this <unk> .

the research , it 's just nuts , how little girl who supported it .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope that your desire to pass it . thanks so much .
bg : thanks .
a few years , at ted , apropos of peter <unk> a <unk> called the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is pretty straightforward . <unk> have to achieve <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , it 's about <unk> tape , it 's about <unk> thread , and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow 've got up on the head .
and when there really just seems , it 's actually really though it because people are staring us very quickly to cooperate .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea is that i and it into a <unk> turns out .
it was a huge success .
i 've been estimated 70 workshops world 's done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there is some of this task , what deep impressions in the nature of collaboration enabled and i want some to share with .
usually they start the most people themselves in terms of task to orient .
they talk about , you think , how it 's look , they wrestle for power ,
then they invest a little time in planning and organization . you drawing , putting <unk> out .

and finally , just before they do n't go to have more to lose somebody a marshmallow and they put him gently move into the top , do n't just step back and `` <unk> '' ! admire their work .
what but then , almost always , happens is that the `` <unk> '' to a <unk> '' is , because it knows the marshmallow does that the whole thing that actually curls and <unk> .
there 's a series of people are much more `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and among the worst , fresh <unk> .
you lie , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
so obviously there also team that much more `` <unk> '' <unk> , and dropping below the best , fresh alumni of this kindergarten .
and that 's pretty amazing .
how our loved peter told they produce more than the highest towers , but the interesting structures of all .
what you may be wondering is , what is that ? why ? what about whom ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of children spent time in the head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they spend any time in <unk> .
there are , but yet another reason .
and that is that <unk> trained that were the a real plan to find , ok !
it and then one realized .
then what happens when you the marshmallow for the top to grab , you have no time and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , is that it with the marshmallow is beginning and prototypes to create a successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on top , so that they many times have an opportunity <unk> prototypes to fix .
constructionists see this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get their immediate feedback , what works , what does n't .
so is the performance , using prototypes to work , a lot -- but let 's a sudden , how other teams of imagery .
the average for most 's around about . <unk> , <unk> create the half of lawyers bit better , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the ultimate thing i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles and understand <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build systems to build .
ceos are about average , but here it gets interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator at the team , they become significantly more .
it 's unbelievable . you see around and see , `` this team will win . ''
you can predict . why does this ?
because they have special faculties to the <unk> have .
they pour the process , you see him .

<unk> skills and <unk> and combined , lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have that typically do you , you ca : sixth need to build systems have .
i tried to now we really exciting .
i thought that 's bring the <unk> same .
so drastically , i a <unk> dollar prize to software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
so this happened . not a team had to build a structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high construction built had , he had the paycheck home and worn away .
so it 's not interesting that high <unk> a powerful effects of ?
we reenacted this exercise with the same school students .
what you think happened here ?
well understood the advantage of the <unk> . ''
so i incautiously turned out that same bad team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the single time .
there are sort of the <unk> lessons for us , about nature of panic and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually time to invest a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i <unk> digital tools and processes to build out teams to help , cars , games or `` <unk> <unk> '' to create .
and what the <unk> does is , it helps you find hidden assumptions out to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is offering a shared experience , a common language , or ethos , the right prototype in making .
and this is the value of the experience , this as easy to practice .
and those of them as there are interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow is building .
there 's a <unk> there .
they 're crazy examples from all around how people the system telescope and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that structure actually a <unk> sports is .
it requires that we all our senses at the task to fix them , that our thinking optimally use the way our feelings and we do , in the challenge that before us about .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype of the experience anything that it takes , it from a `` <unk> '' -- to a <unk> '' moment to bring .
and that can a big difference do .
thanks .
we do something like we have a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a certain .
and everybody in this room has to skeletal muscle .
and you have to the past go , you can in the future go ; they can not in here and now can stay
and i wonder what they would choose , because i my friends recently , often asked this question , and they wanted everybody in the past go .
i do n't . they wanted to the time ago , before it cars were or twitter or `` america in seeking the superstars . ''
i do n't .
i 'm convinced that you kind of nostalgia , to <unk> drawn is .
and that i understand .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and not because i have a explorers am .
it 's because that capability on earth 's not go back , you go ahead .
i want so in this machine , and i want to the future of the way .

there was never been a time as that .
my <unk> dying every once they got 60 were .
my grandparents urged her that number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 percent to hurl the .
there was so good as a nine as i started <unk> are .
but it 's not going to people like us , because it is a larger point of this .
a child , today in <unk> 's born can wait long as to live as the richest man on earth are 100 years ago .
think about this . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox : the smallpox was a billion people on earth 's killed .
they have the demographics of earth in a way of new form , how it 's no war ever managed to .
they are out . they 're gone .
we have you <unk> . oxide .
in the wealthy world are diseases , the millions of us from the only one generation also threatened , barely finished yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
if you know anything else that somebody , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that 's both successes of scientific method .
and in my view is the scientific method -- things to try to look , whether it works , it change as it does n't strike , the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
sadly , it really all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were frequently i mentioned ,
and one of which is that in spite of all achievements , a billion people around the world every day hungry going to sleep .
this number drops , and she gets very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and more than that , we have our ability to be used , this planet properly account for <unk> .
drinking , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , which was soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> disappearing , we also .
the question is : we can do that ? i think that .
i think it 's clear that we eat food can make that billion people feed , without the country , on her life , to rape her .
i think we can see the world of power , you are not with it destroyed .
i believe that really , and no , that 's no <unk> .
but this keeps me at night awake , one thing that 's look at night awake , often . we have scientific advances are never been desperately to come like now , never ,
and we were also never been able to properly <unk> , as we of it can .
we 're on the cusp of an amazing , amazing event in many places . and yet i think in fact that we are hundreds of 300 years ago , the enlightenment go back , had to create a time to find where we progress detriment , where we used to make these massive <unk> have , at all fronts as well .
people of the husks of their faith , which was so intimately that you could n't want to dig it .
n't even the truth will they free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his mind , even a right on his view of progress ,
but you know what you , there are right ?
they have no right for their own data . <unk> , it did n't .
and i have a while needed to determine this .
back about a decade , i have an article on shots for the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to bump , in opposition to what the end of the effective thing . within health in history of humanity 's .
i did n't know what i should do , so i did easy thing i do , i wrote an article and continued .
and soon i wrote an article about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were going berserk .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand why the people thought that was `` <unk> , why they believed that molecule increases in a particular , instead of an accidental kind <unk> a <unk> on the area of nature was .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote this paper , i went on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we tap , we join a , we eat out that 's okay .
but these articles were doing was worried , and i could n't want to discover why , and i would eventually it out .
and that 's because that these <unk> to me nuts were doing does n't <unk> were .
these were <unk> people , educated people you 're decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and i was such total kludge .
but then i thought , you know what , let 's face .
we 're at some point , where we actually not the same proportion of progress , as before .
we talk <unk> it .
we talk about it ironic that , with small quotes about `` progress . ''
okay , for this case , and i think we know which causes these are .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science to be lost , and we have no reason you 're not that should be .
you can just a couple of names call and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , <unk> that <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can tell your list vote .
there are questioning and problems with people that we believed that they always right . so be skeptical .
so you ask , costing them evidence , costing them evidence .
take nothing for granted .
now they get ready , if you evidence to get you have this evidence to assume , and there are not good .
and i can go from the reason to say that we go to an epidemic of fear life , i do you never seen , and hopefully will never see me .
back about 12 years was a story posted , a horrific story that the <unk> with measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in connection made me .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see whether that true .
tons of studies should be conducted . that 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all together , any correlation , no link , no .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we of anecdotes think we believe what we see what we look at believe what does that we really feel .
we wo n't think about a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , then i understand that , i think we do all .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating ,
devastating , because of this fact : the u.s. is one single country in the world where the <unk> to get measles down .
this is <unk> and we should become embarrassed .
it 's horrible .
what happened that we do that could .
now , i understand that . i am .
because it does anybody here measles ?
has one in the audience ever hear somebody who get measles dying with this ?
does n't very often .
happening in this country 's not , but 160,000 time in the last year .
these are many deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because n't it 's happening is , we can crowd out , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk and sending messages of anxiety and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation should n't fused .
they do n't that these things does seem to be , but virtually never the same ones .
and this is something that we have to learn , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .

not fearful , no distress , <unk> phew , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
he says , paul <unk> .
he has just with some other people have a <unk> developed .
he does the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing save .
pretty well , right ?
now , which is good , besides that paul pair of and through vaccines that speaks says , how valuable they are , and that people just need to stop to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's a terrorist .
if paul in a public confirmation talks , he can not without being armed guardians statements .
he 's getting calls home , because people he likes to tell you know where his children to go to school .
and why ? because paul wrote a vaccine has done .
i need to do n't say , but vaccines are essential .
you put them on to return to the diseases come back , terrible disease , and this is happening .
we have in this country now measles .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just get measles die .
what about <unk> ? take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine took me , a few weeks written and told you think i 'm a little too <unk> .
nobody , ever said earlier .
they would their children not against <unk> immunized . no way .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't <unk> have . and guess what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , no <unk> .
now , i know , maybe he got this morning guy in lagos at a plane and fly straight to los angeles , now , he died of ohio .
and in a few hours , it lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight it has gone .
and he did n't know that he of debilitating illness or infected , and we know that could n't , because so the world works well time .
this is the planet , which we live . they do n't , as if it does n't it 's .
we love this , to lie to the husks of . we love this .
you have this morning everybody their vitamins to the point ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , and go on the hops helps .
i know that they did , because half the americans that every day power .
they take the stuff , and you take alternative is causing , and it does n't matter how often we find that they are useless to them .
the data of evidence from the time .
they darkening them on their urine , more do you almost no .
it 's okay , they want to 70 billion dollars for the dark side of urine numbers .
i agree with them entirely too .
darker the urine , dark .
why do this ? why do this ?
now , i think that i see -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate each one too strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should not . our healthcare is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> to us that it can afford .
we go so that way , and where do we ?
we walk into the poor of <unk> .
it 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's quite a serious business , because this stuff is poo , and we spend a billion dollars for quieting down .
and i 've all sorts of little props about here .
none of -- <unk> , again , <unk> , again , <unk> , because i wo n't even what this is , but we spend billions of dollars , looking for , they 're cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , scream at the people and you say , `` what anyone cares what you ? let people wo n't do what they want .
so they feel good . ''
and guess what you have wrong .
because it really matter is , what is the minister who is : `` hmm , i 'm the evidence of experts to whom mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , of your patients with <unk> treat want .
if you look at this road entering , where do believe and magic evidence and science can replace , get them on the place where they do n't be like .
they go to <unk> <unk> in south africa .

hundreds undue deaths in a country , the worse than any of this disease absolutely will .
tell me , ah , that these things not a consequence out .
they have you . that they 've always .
now , the <unk> epidemic in which we face now , is this ridiculous battle between the <unk> <unk> modified foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about how metaphor .
this ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , every <unk> , by the people changed .
you know , it was no <unk> in paradise .
it was no <unk> .
it was no christmas trees . we have this all done .
we have it in the last 11,000 years doing .
and some of it 's worked and some of this is not .
we 're <unk> what did n't work .
now we can be more to do . and obviously there risks . but we can really the beta-carotene , in rice and do , the stuff can million people to help millions of people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say that i understand not .
we cling <unk> changed the food off .
why do it ?
so what i always listening is , too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't a huge areas with a cause that 's wrong .
we do n't want that companies are living in flight .
we do n't want that companies seeds have .
and you know what my response to all this is ?
yes , they are right . fix this .
it is , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
so it with science is nothing to do .
it 's quite fond of morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we science -- not allow them to their work to do because we’re afraid of is really a stop-up , and they keep millions of people of blooming from .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're 70 percent longer growing food to be the moment . 70 percent .
that investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . ashamed .
they need that , and we give you 're not .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people not to encourage that <unk> stuff to eat , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that a half billion people eat .
it 's sort of a potato .
it 's just a bunch more calories . it 's miserable .
it has no resources , it 's not a protein , and scientists building it all right at a .
and then you might ask people the food and would n't see them .
they would n't starving , and guess what ?
if so beautiful . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it was pretty .
and everything that i 'm going to say , this is : why stop it ?
i mean , we wonder : why stop it ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about genes <unk> . it 's not chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion at hormones , our insisting on , more food , better food , unprecedented act of food .
it 's not going to the rice <unk> , it 's about people were alive to get , and it 's time again , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do if we so on doing as far do we look at a little bit guilty , where we actually , i think , not guilty to be like , high-tech colonialism .
there are no other description for what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our n't worthy , and we need that 's still stop .
after that really fun entertainment so you want you might say `` will you still in this ridiculous certain and in the future to go ? ''
certainly , and let me , anyway .
now , put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see certain everything to imagine what we want .
we can you <unk> where we do you <unk> want , and we get there is moving , where we want .
we have these conversations can now , and we need to think , but if we come into a certain up , and in the future of the way we will be relieved that made for .
i know that we can , and get it my case that 's something that the world needs now .
thanks .
thanks .
for some time interests me for the <unk> . it may weird stuff that 's a magician , really interested , unless there , they look it like me , as a deception , which became somewhat true is that if you just for sure enough to believe . ''
in other words , <unk> have in some studies a measurable effect on shown that <unk> , which is just because the person thinks about what with it 's going to be a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there , if the patient , really tightly enough believe , a measurable effect on his body of that the <unk> calls .
a deception is going to be true because somebody 's like seeing .
so we find mutually also understanding , i want to go through a fundamental , very simple trick them .
and i 'll show what it works . this is a trick that least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for kids ' .
i , saw him from <unk> scout magic of <unk> in the 1970s learned .
i 'm kind of them out and it 'll explain .
and then i 'll explain why i would explain .
so , you see what happens .
the knife , that you look at that can of my hand , which you look at that can .

i push my sleeve up .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappear and of him out , i 'll just my wrist right here <unk> .
it 's how you can see that look at any time at any moving . as i here <unk> , can zip in my sleeve , villages , or paint .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is the knife by my bare physical magnetics watching .
it sits actually so stuck on its place that i 'm going to shake it , without having the knife <unk> .
nothing goes into my sleeve , comes out , no <unk> . and they can study .
<unk> .
well , this is a trick that i often a little kids <unk> that concern for magic of doing , because you can help you very much about deception to learn when you specifically looking , although it a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works .
i keep the knife in my hand .
i say that i want my wrist <unk> to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason why i my wrist <unk> , is that at the real secret of illusion is .

wonderful trick ?
back there is someone who 's not a childhood had .
so , he 's here . right .
and if i 'm <unk> , changing the finger in its position .
and now you could talk about , why this is a deception is why you do n't seeing that down here just three fingers to see is : because the mind and the way that he information processing , they 're not one that matter , one , two , three , but they pack and see .
but it 's about this is not actually , and then , open my hand .

and when i mean by hand , i close to happen the same using , i <unk> , going through this movement , unseen . the finger to <unk> .
i assume that hand away . and this is that knife .
this trick we can get your friends and neighbor to demonstrate . thanks .
so what does it with <unk> to do ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that i 'm really just blew up .
i 'm not a doctor or explorers , and so i was going to me an amazing thing .


and that , although almost none of any <unk> -- this is just <unk> .
but a white pills is not just about a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak .
it turns out what turned out that 's not all is .
if you capsules that will , are still <unk> as their tablets of every form .
a colored capsule that look at the end of yellow and across the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
so do <unk> a role .
a pill twice a day is not just about three pills -- i 'm not going to capture the statistics remember . sorry .
the key though , is ...
... that 's also the doses of a difference .
and the form a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , we need to the needle reach out .

that creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much worse than a white pills .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to another time to show , if you <unk> have .
fact , is that the white pills not as good looks like the blue pill , which is n't just looks like a capsule that not just looks like the needle .
and none of it has some really <unk> property . it 's only our believe that goes around with a greater impact lead .
i wanted to know if i this idea for a trick could use .
i take something that obviously a deception is , and i leave it really looks .
we know , looking at the study that you to the needle access to when it 's an enormous amount is about .
this is an 18 feet long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'll give you start a little bit of sterile .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special cultured meat .
this is my skin . that 's no <unk> from hollywood .
i 'll discuss this needle in my skin stick and through them through drive till you on the other hand , again <unk> .
if you culprit is -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i did that a few friends last night in the hotel hand , and some people who i did n't , and what 's a woman who almost fainted from .
so i ago , if you very nasty , then they looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm the first sensitive to be part back here is done .
you can see , you can also <unk> , if you like .
so , it 's so , right here where my ham starts to the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a little puncture do .
does n't really sorry . she does this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same condition that we took in <unk> had .
about .
but now you can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so i 'll use them show . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what people imagine if you see that .
they say `` okay , who 's probably not so stupid and <unk> himself the skin , just to us a few minutes to speak . ''
now , then i 'm going to show .
what does this out ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people back to say `` okay . i do n't actually seen . ''
people in the <unk> get right now in .
let 's me tell you up close to show .
this is really my skin . that 's no <unk> from hollywood .
it 's my ham , and i think that 's <unk> .
sorry . if you culprit is going to take away , look n't eat .
people back or the ones that later , eventually , once on video to see , will say , `` well , which is yes , very impressive , but if it really wanted to be , it would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really want to be , it would we bleed . ''
okay , let me some blood for you <unk> .
yes , this is it .
usually i would go through the needle out .
i would my arm spill-cleaning and you show that there 's not the wounds of us .
but i think , in this scale here and with intent , from a deception something real time , doing is me the needle in plain is inside , let and so from the stage to go .
we 're in the next days have a few times each other .
i hope you enjoy yourself going on . thanks .
every talk today about the happiness .
i have some people the number of books they count off that with `` <unk> '' from the headline in the last five years or published by introducing and they gave about 40 up , and there was much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest in luck of explorers .
there are very much <unk> .
and everybody likes to people happy little bit .
but despite all of flood of work , there 's several different cognitive fall that there were impossible make a clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly by these cognitive take action .

the first of the fall is a <unk> , complexity actually acknowledge .
it turns out that the word of happiness is simply not a useful word more importantly , because we 're too many different things work .
i think there 's a particular meaning that 's take a hedge could , but in and large that 's something that we gave up to be , and we are the complicated perspective i think to have on what we comfort is .
the second case , a really confuses most of experience and memory , basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we 're not about a circumstance that can think , the well-being is affected , without its significance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there are just a way , it right -- the elevator .
now i 'd like to an example start by somebody who 's a <unk> had to one of lectures , of a story told . [ unclear ... '' he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely splendid music , and very end of recording a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it 's attach , really very emotional , which has the whole experience was ruined .
but it did n't .
what it ruins had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience anyway .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care , not because it with a memory <unk> was born , the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that 's going to keep that had received .
what we 've actually says is that we come over and about other people think we could be in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> self that in the present those alive and the present know , is able to the past and to experience , but basically just the present time .
it 's the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know when the doctor says , `` do now it hurts when i me show <unk> ? ''

or `` what was their journey to albania ? '' or something like .
these are two very different entities that <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and the two to confuse this is part of <unk> of <unk> about happiness .
well , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really a basic reaction to our memories of -- it begins immediately , .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we can make a story to tell .
our memory shares stories , which is what we of our experiences keep that allowed is a story .
and let <unk> with an example start .
there are an old one study .
that 's real patients who became a painful procedure that brain scanner .
i 'm not in detail about . you today is n't hurt anymore , but she was painful , when that study the 1990s was done .
they were asked , all 60 seconds about their pain , and tell .
and there are two patients . that 's your records .
and they 're wondering , who could either of did n't have suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b is clearly has n't have suffered . his <unk> been longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how much thought these patients that they have struggled with ? ''
and there 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient is a , a lot <unk> <unk> of the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a really vital part of history is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and that are worse is used to where the pain , really the end up its zenith , was . it 's a bad history .
how we know that ?
because we these people by their <unk> asked , and too much later , `` how bad news was the whole thing total of ?
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
now , which is a direct fight between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even have b is a clear <unk> time .
so what you with the patient of a , could do , and we 've actually clinical experiments , and it 's been , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of patient is a vector by just the hose in there has no one of him to shakes things .
this is going to rediscover that the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and so if you a few minutes has power to internalize that the <unk> themselves from the patient is a worse off , and you have consequences that the <unk> themselves from the patient is a much better off this , because now , patient is a , a better story about his experience history .
what makes a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory we discover magazine and it true of the stories that we invent .


well , that <unk> even live his life grow .
it are moments of <unk> , one after another .
and they ask : how about those moments , ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most moments , a lifetime -- and i did this is focused on , you know , the psychological present considered about three seconds long , which means , you know that it in a life around 600 million of these are . in a month 's about 600,000 , most of you leave no path .
most of you are completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet they get kind of the impression that they count things that thing during these moments of <unk> happens our lives is .
it 's the finite resource that we use as we 're in the world are .
and how we they consume would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> itself to we keep .
so we have the <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the deal with time .
of view of <unk> even if you a holiday and the second one week , just like this is good as the first , it 's the <unk> vacation twice as well the <unk> vacation .
that does not calling for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation ridiculously better than the <unk> holiday , because there 's no new memories added up .
they have the story does n't changed .
and it 's how is time actually the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . of time , very little difference on this story .
well , that <unk> make it yourself anymore , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually the one of this was making decisions , because if you a patient , the , maybe two <unk> at two different surgeons had and they decide what he chose to do it is the , the votes of the memory , the less bad , and this is the surgeon who was selected will become .
this <unk> itself has no voice in the election .
actually choose , we move between those moments , we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we of the future thinking , we think about our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future for as <unk> memories .
and basically we can do you look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can see this <unk> even think more than one that sort of the <unk> even <unk> through experience that the <unk> do n't need .
i have the impression that if we travel to make this very often the case , which means that we go on vacation largely on services of <unk> itself .
and that 's a bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we of our memories ?
this is the reason that for the dominance of <unk> itself is given .
and when i think about , i think about a vacation that we , a few years in antarctica 've done , who clearly the best to travel was , i 've ever had , and i think quite frequently used in proportion to how often i 'm going to other holidays think .
and i 've probably from my studies memories of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the past four years <unk> .
now if i ever the folder open , and i would be connected with 600 of pictures of course having an unexpected lesson spent .
now , that 's three weeks , and this , greenwash half hours .

now , i like a little extreme , you know , in how little appetite , i went on the <unk> of memories , but even if you more of doing it is a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight that we experiences be ?
so i want that they had a <unk> think .
imagine your next to travel that you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures gutted , and you have a <unk> drug , so that they 're going to do n't remember being .
now , you would the same two holidays and vote ?
and if you another vacation would choose , they have a conflict between her two types of self and you must think about how they were viewing this choice and this is really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories think they could have another answer to get .
why we the holidays , pick out that we enlist is a problem that we had to make a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self : drop two words about happiness in .
there are actually two ideas about happiness that we can use , one per second self .
so you can ask : how happy that 's <unk> itself ?
and then you 'd say , as happy are those moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- happiness in moments , is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that view , can be ?
and , the way , we 're now just look at a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> itself over the time .
if you for the privilege of <unk> even asking it 's a different one thing .
this is not about how happy one person is alive .
it 's about how fulfilling and enjoying the person 's when they 're about her life system .
very different term .
anybody who these concepts n't distinguish it 's exploration of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being that exploration of happiness long screwed up on these same way .

the <unk> organization has a global survey , the more than half a million people getting questions that have been about what you about her life thinking about and their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
in recent years , there 's begun to do about happiness in the two types of self to learn .
and the <unk> thing that we think , i 've learned is that they really differently about .
you can know how to please anybody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about how excited he live your and reverse .
just to you a sense of the correlation of bed , the correlation 's about <unk> .
what this is that if you know someone be met and you 'd just say , oh , his father 's a <unk> how much would you about his greatness know ?
well , they were about his greatness know , but there are much uncertainty .
they were so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that someone your life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , they much uncertainty about how excited he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the happiness of <unk> rules .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means you very pleased to be with people who we like that time to spend with people who we like .
there are other occupational pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you the privilege of two types of self can maximize want you 'll end very different things .
the implication of what i 've said , is that we 're lucky i do n't introduce you should be a backup to comfort .
it 's a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason , which we do n't know about happiness can think is that we 're not on the same things as if we think about life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question how excited the people in california are they will not the correct response time .
if they ask you think that people in california , happy to be if you , say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about life in california , who think you think of the difference between california and elsewhere , and that difference is , say , in climate .
now , it turns out that climate not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful self that decide how excited people are .
but now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you can come up -- some people might end to california to move .
and it 's sort of interesting to track of what happens to people who had to california to move in hopes , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy to be .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier , because if you think about you 'll remember is going to how awful the weather in ohio gave , and they 'll feel that they are the right decision have met .
it 's very difficult to clear about well-being thinking , and i hope , i have you a sense of it should learn how hard it 's .
thanks .
thanks . i have a question for them .
thanks .
so when we , a few weeks phone 've talked about them towards me that it 's a pretty interesting thing , which had this <unk> survey found .
that 's something where they 're participating can climb , because they now a few minutes left of ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most exciting thing that we in <unk> survey ever have found is a number that we absolutely not to find thought was .
we found that in terms of the privilege of <unk> itself .
if we semi-circle looking at how emotions with the income of footholds that .
and it turns out that in income of 60,000 per year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a lot of representative sample , under a salary for about 600,000 dollars a year
60,000 .
dk : 60 .
60,000 per year , people are deeply unhappy , and they 're increasingly less , the poorer now people .
that we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely make flat line seen .
what happens is obvious that money to do n't <unk> 17th , but that lack of money one certainly misery and raise , and we can talk of misery truly , very clear to measure .
in terms of other self , of <unk> itself , they get another story .
the more money you earned the more of satisfaction is you .
it 's not in emotions .
but danny , the entire american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people this database take seriously , did i mean , it feels it upside down to ask , everything that we think that for example in terms of <unk> and so forth .
they have a chance that politicians that land is generally a database of the gravity would take and then based upon politics would do ?
dk : you know , i believe that there are mindshare and then there for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is starting to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does it right and in other countries have that it right .
the people are starting to acknowledge that it in luck to think should be if we look at the political thinking .
it will be a while , and the people will discuss that if you <unk> explore their desks or whether they <unk> look like , so we have that discussion pretty soon bring .
how fortunate to increase can go very differently depending how you think and if you look at the <unk> even think or whether you look at the <unk> even imagine .
this is politics can control , i think , in the next year .
in the united states <unk> you look at that <unk> the population start measuring .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national stats like .
well , it strikes me that this topic is , or should least , the most important political debate to track be about the next few years .
thanks for the invention of <unk> .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i make games .
i becoming now for 10 years <unk> . and my aim for the next decade is , it as easy to make the world , in reality to save you 're doing in <unk> to save is .
i have a plan for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time to play , more and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
perhaps slightly too much time , if you consider how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve this .
now , my research on the institute for the future , according to is the opposite accurately .

indeed , i 'm convinced that if we do the next century on earth 's survival want to move the time dramatically increase to .
i 've calculated that the kind of time in 21 billion hours <unk> per week about .
it appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i 'm going to create a way ca : if we issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity is to solve , i think , we have to try to play online for least , 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes the exact condition , why i believe that games are so vital for survival of human species in the future are . seriously .
this is the picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so he was the players a camera put up .
this is one of this classic expression of playing video .
if you have any players are , and avoid them some of nuances in this image .

if you also play , you see certain nuances here , which semen up <unk> eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows present surprise .
this is a player , the edge of the so-called epic <unk> you can .
oh , you know the -- ok. be neat . so we have some outstanding players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , this so extremely positive is that they were n't know that we 've ever been possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it 's a shock , actually be able to have to be aware . this is a <unk> victory .
these gamer is about an indian epic victory .
and this is what we on millions of faces of <unk> around the world is where we need , if we are challenging the next century are attacking . the face of those that contrary giving in the edge of the epic <unk> are .
well , unfortunately , we see sort of the face in real life if we difficult problems facing .
i call it as the `` in life i 'm a bad . <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , what i did `` in life i 'm a bad . <unk> do .
this is a graffiti on my former home at berkley , california where i in my ph.d. studying how we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem that many other players have .
we think that we the reality is not as well there are locked in games .
and i mean not only less successful , although it and as part .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean well in relation to the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to work together .
if we in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us into our best version turn , anytime and immediately <unk> 're working hard the problem solving try to have been so how much needed to be looking at a failure , again and try .
and the reality , if we fail , if we came across barriers , into feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel reversal . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings that we 've never , if we play games , in games are they simply not .
and that 's what i as <unk> study wanted .
why is it into play impossible to think , you could n't anything possible ?
how we can these feelings are to play in the reality spread ?

and i have some things started to the epic victories of <unk> so do .

but not just some mission , but a mission that are perfectly to its current level in games does , right ?
so they make it .
they have never a task , you are not going to solve .

you 're not around and turns <unk> . it 's always be detected something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they also going to be hundreds of people who inspire them together to change epic mission to this problem .
so we in real life is not just that emotion that at a <unk> tons of staff are willing to stand .
and then is this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then there 's all of the positive feedback .
they 've driven by `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength '' or heard `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant feedback is n't there in real life .
when i do this stage was leaving , i did n't do is plus-one talk and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback , not .

they 're just better than the reality .
now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , spent the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to think about it in context of vision : at <unk> million years , i started our first <unk> upright to go .
the first upright primate so .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we are playing , spend , do it just make sense , when you have the time in terms of scale of human flourishing looking at each holding what the most people that .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out that we , by this whole time looking at the play using , actually changing this , what we as humans to have the power .

this is the truth . believe me .
consider all these interesting statistic that recently from a researcher at carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> by the 21st of age .
so , 10,000 hours is an extraordinarily interesting number , from two reasons .
now , , for children in america are <unk> hours to capture the <unk> that you in school to spend , from the fifth grade , up to leave high school . if you never absent .
so we 've got a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning what it means that a good players to be as anything , what you in school learn .
and maybe some of them the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you 've had his theory of your success , the theory 's success 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great science of <unk> that if we scraped 10,000 hours to and laborious study of any subject to the 21st of age of congress spend , we 're going to rise of course .
we are so good at whatever to do what the most important people the world .
so what we have here is an entire generation of young people who <unk> are .
the big question is so `` what exactly are player <unk> right ? ''
because if we find out , if we basically 'd never here <unk> human potential available .
so many people we 've now in the world , the least an hour in one day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> : 500 million people who were extraordinarily well , `` what . '' are .
and the next decade we have another billion players , which is exceptionally good in whatever that are .
if they 've never heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy savings and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online , you can play .
you expect throwing another billion player in this next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to contemplate what it 's , what 's have these games to have mastered is done .
there are the four things that i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine that the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , instantly wanted to do , a challenge to rise , with the belief that we have a <unk> hope to have success .
players to think about that a <unk> victory possible , and that these are always be worth , it to try and that moment .
players are not vice versa .
players are masters of spiders poet of social networks .
there 's a lot more interesting studies that indicate that we people more like , after we with you have played , even if you 're evil to beat up .
the reason is that 's a lot of trust takes , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on that any time with us to spend that the rules would be honored to be the same purpose and have to <unk> to stay .
so allow this together the growing of ties to trust and together .
as a consequence of you build greater social relations in .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week doing plays to speak , as <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we 're really happy with you to work hard , as if we wanted to relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings can optimally use functional , if we 're stiff , great bidding .
and players are always ready , to work hard , if you the real problem keeping fires .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love this , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> magnitude of this .
here a <unk> , to illuminate the back , you know definitely all the wikipedia , the biggest wiki the world .

five million people use it every month .

you build another epic story .

ok , so that 's four superpowers to a single thing to take action gamers are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it 's people who believe that they 're a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that you believe , you can the virtual worlds are changing , but not the reality .
this is the problem that i 'm going to solve try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he studies , why people as much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of nothing less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he goes ...
not just like me , i becoming more games , i 'm doing something <unk> .
so he says , this makes actually make sense , because player can in <unk> achieve more than in real life .
you can in games holds the social ties that other than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently is entirely obvious that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree to first time to imagine that 's obvious .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start to the real world in a game into this .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years ago .
there are those ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> there <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the work ancient greek <unk> <unk> are familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about how and why games have invented up .
according <unk> got games , particularly <unk> , the kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
supposedly , we had such a great famine , that the king of <unk> to a crazy idea took it .
people have struggled . people fought .
it was an extreme conditions . it took an extreme solution .
so they invented , according <unk> that <unk> and <unk> a national energy strategy . in one day would you eat . next day you would play .
and they were so much in the <unk> <unk> be that i 'll play so fascinating , and connect to satisfying to <unk> productivity surrounding that you remember that would that 's nothing to eat out there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowed them as 18 years that famine , by one day where were eating and the following played .
likewise , i think it 's now play a .
we put play a to suffer the real world to escape .
we put play a to everything to avoid that in the real world 's broken , everything that in real life does n't consider “real” value is , and we bring us what we need are to play .
but it does not the end to be .
this is the exciting .

they divided the kingdom of two halves .
you played a <unk> and the winner got to another epic adventure to shift .
they were <unk> and rendered into the lookout for a new home . they had just so many people back , as food to surviving there and went to the rest for an area where they 're thriving could .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> that later the roman empire arose , the same dna as the old <unk> whatsoever .
so i did scientists recently at the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and geologists thought evidence of global cooling , which almost 20 years before , what the famine and tell you could .
and you might the crazy story to vote .
maybe they 've actually their people through the same ones saved by looking at 18 years in games <unk> have and then this intuition , and so much about the other ones who learned that it makes the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .

it was the first <unk> in real-time the world of <unk> . it was 16 years before .

i want to say , we 're ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent the half of civilization in the quest for a new world . so i took my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should there <unk> that half of us an hour day was playing , spend , until we really hard of the real world have solved .
i know , they will say `` how we solve problems the real world in play ? '' and this particular question i mean work in recent years of the institute for the future the expectation .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it push out how to the future should figure out .
we do n't want to try to the future ahead to say .
what we want it 's the future to make .
we want to make the most results ; and then people do it <unk> , this idea in the reality home .
we imagine epic victories of and give people the possibility of reaching them .
we 'll take a comment about three different games that i 've designed to try to people epic victories by your own future to speak up .
this is `` world without oil . ''
this game is in 2007 .
it 's a game where you a <unk> overcome these issues .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> so it for it looks realistic , and your real life in fact , without oil our lives . so , when they have to play register , just tell us , where you live . and then you 'll get <unk> in real-time , the show how much oil costs , what 's not exist as food at risk is being transported at risk is whether to school closed , whether it uprisings have . and they have to figure out how your real life make when it 's true about it . and we ask them to me to blog , video or taking photos hiring .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 test . and we have you ever since over the last three years traveling .
and i urge you say , it was changing the experience .
nobody wants to be life change , because it is good at the environment is , because we should .
but if it in epic adventure , and told you get `` we 're doing the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure , on that you go .
you find out how to survive her going . most of gamers have in the game learning habits maintained .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher purpose of expertise as just <unk> .
we have the game `` <unk> '' the institute for the future of its own .
baseline is computation as a <unk> , that people can only have 23 years in the planet ended up .
this massive supercomputer called global <unk> <unk> , '' .

you know jerry <unk> where it 's `` <unk> '' is . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just crashed , you can save the world .
but in our games , instead of only five people , say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player up playing the game was five weeks ' worth .
they were 500 incredibly creative solutions that you read them , if you `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we take on three . march out . it 's a game in conjunction with the world bank .
if you the game to conclude , they gain from the world bank , the distinction `` social <unk> , once in 2010 .

we have a comic that , we have `` level up , for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all you invite the game with young people to share , around the world , especially in <unk> , the benefit to move along their own social enterprises imagine , the world to save .
i am going to the end .
i want you some questions .
what you think that happens next ?
we 've all those fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have the real world has n't be saved .
well , i hope to me how do agree that players are human resources are we have to work in real life can use , and that play a great significance to change in .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social networks to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we go along great play games to all earth 's another century to survive .
and i hope you 're going to me like play design and play .
if i want to the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things not sure , that we each <unk> future can make , and that we all sorts of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games are beginning !
thanks .
i 'd just like to share something that 's mine , a few months to write an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write more and my <unk> fingertips , but i was writing the great frontier of <unk> already done , and i realized that i never happened in my life <unk> have what the word `` evacuating , '' actually means .
i read them a post about .

<unk> : well , strong , powerful . ''

obviously this a <unk> , old <unk> . i 'm going to think that the readout pretty age should .
but actually it was a copy of the early '80s when i just with the elementary started , and started to my model elsewhere in my family terribly building and to form , in terms of other kids and the rest world around me .
and thank god , i did n't <unk> used .
i 'd like this post take seriously i 'd be in the world was born that someone like me as a person would perceive , whose lives in <unk> 's how positive go away . today , but i want to the opportunity and adventure , which i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i i immediately the <unk> of 2009 called and expecting that i 'm here a <unk> contributions to find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately it 's not much better .
especially a shock to the last two words of `` <unk> <unk> '' `` well , '' `` well . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about what we thought about people think that we with these words describe .
it 's about the values that in these words stuck , and how to those values , constructing weights .
our language affects our thinking and how to the world , and people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the the greek and the roman , have really believed that the sound reinforcement of <unk> a great force , because what you hear it <unk> , it can manifest .
so what we want you think of manifest -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
just a human <unk> as a child to call , could do , you know about curtailing and share ideas <unk> .
it would not nice , you doors to open up ?
a person , the top of my door opened up , i had a pediatrician in <unk> . dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can imagine , most americans do n't counted correctly tell you could eat . so he became increasingly , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. had always very colorful fly and was for the work with kids out how we created .
i found the time that i in this hospital , i spent , just great -- except for my <unk> .
i needed a single little exercise it seems that infinite number of times , you ought to these thicknesses of <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you 've had to my <unk> building . and i have these down at all hated worse than anything else . i did they hated it . i have you 're haunted . i did they hated it .
and imagine that i whistled even been known as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so trying to these systems to stop , <unk> not succeeding .
and one day he made me at a i practiced observation -- these systems were just tiring and mercilessly , and he said to me , `` wow , is aimee , you 're like a lot of <unk> and young girl , you 'll someday , one of the ligament organs .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i the systems do that i did n't want to do with the prospect that richest five-year-old kid in the ward in the second stick to be . but he got me actually get started to my daily <unk> through fresh eyes to see . it turned out a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now how much of his vision for me as strong and <unk> young girl my model of shaped , and i would never imagined , me as an inherently strong , powerful and <unk> human to see .
this is just an example of many , as adults in <unk> the imagination a child 's engaging together .
but how are already <unk> examples from the <unk> prove that makes us our language no room , is something to imagine what we all wish i would say it every single be able to yourself as powerful people in .

the medical records of view from outer you can course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium or artificial <unk> for <unk> body that allow people , really all their opportunities to use and over the boundaries of them their natural fortune was set , out to develop , not going to talk about social <unk> platforms that people make up with my own identity , put on your way , redefining , and that the world to groups are choosing that they 're going to enlist .
maybe it gets so this technological change powerful because the that it always a different truth gave , namely , that every human society at something very <unk> and very <unk> can give you and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to -- it 's an interesting story because people me every time to ask to tell , i do with giving deal and i 'm about something ta : that sentence , but what i never <unk> and i 'm always very uncomfortable with it felt that question of people do it to answer , and i think , gradually i can understand why .
this phrase from our dealings with giving living by the idea that success or happiness we depend on it , a challenge to rise , devoid of them together can experience shape of this . like my life so successful order to be because i have the potential to drop of life with a prosthetic way that could n't it anyway that people to me with my disability to sense .
but the truth is that we change . so we are from the challenge coined , whether you physically , emotionally , or , both is
and i 'm suggesting that this is good .
giving is no obstacle that we <unk> need to have our lives better to cope .
giving are going to our lives .
and i tend to giving away from my shadow of vision .
sometimes i realize that he was really present is , sometimes it 's hard to see , but it 's always with me .
and i want to save the impact , or the heavy of <unk> a person <unk> .
there are in life , giving and challenges , and they 're just <unk> real and every person walks out of them differently about . but the question is n't know if we 're giving you come , or not , but the way that we really clear understanding .
so we 're not just responsible for that people that we love , before <unk> to maintain , but they also to prepare , well , in order to cope .
and we provide our kids do n't like when we tell you feel that give you ca n't be able to fit .
you have two things that dividing , first of the medical fact , an amputee , to be and the second important social think about whether i helped me or not .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability , with me apart from happening to , is that the world are constantly says , you ca n't help me with definitions that describe .
in our desire , the people to protect that we care anywhere and you the cold , hard truth about their medical projections to communicate or even a prediction for quality to imagine that you have thought we must pay attention , that we not the foundation to put that somebody actually has helped is .

if we 've got people do n't holistically and treat , and not all its structural forces and opportunity to sense , and recognizing do in addition to the natural struggle that you might lead to another disease .
we <unk> a person who wanted to our society , this is worth .
so we have about the <unk> beyond watching and look at all the area of human possibility to focus .
at a sustainable and is that between the perception of mismatch and our magnificent ingenuity , a connection there .

it 's me , maybe more about making sure enough to imagine that we 're giving not necessarily through these issues , but that we should open , you to hug , you to seize the pack to be a <unk> to use , maybe even in order to dance .
and maybe do it , giving as a natural , <unk> and useful to see and feel ourselves that through their presence n't get strained .
so this year celebrate the 200 birthday , by charles darwin and when he had 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very real in the human nature -- pointed out .
i 'd like to paraphrase `` do n't the best performing their way to survive , or neither of <unk> its way , but now , who was changes in the best fit for .
in conflict -- comes out of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work we know that the person 's ability to survive and was blossoming of the battle of human spirit , marmite is that spreads by conflict to turn .
so , again , change and embrace is the great skills of man .

perhaps is exactly the point of giving up with perception of swings , the sense of our own power .
we can not so even a gift .
we can be giving a new meaning that wall , who really tough times beyond the point .
we may giving of climate change those .
giving up for a change that we have n't have adapted .
i think the most of damage that we ourselves <unk> have is to believe that we normally should be .
's face -- who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there are the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , gray person real familiar to learn when it really gets them gandhi ?
i think probably not .
we would love , if we that paradigm of normality versus another the capabilities or the strength to it even slightly dangerous to ask , exchange for ; we get the forces of lots of kids who release and they do you invite your special and valuable skills in the society , emotionally .
<unk> have found that we humans from the members of our society and one claimed that have , useful to be and a contribution to do .

there are these people wo n't be broken and useless level ; they were as a treat and valuable treated .
by a few years i went in the city in which i raised was , in a <unk> in those `` red zone , '' at northeastern part of pennsylvania , and i was there in a <unk> tomato .
it was the summer and i had <unk> on .
and i hear , as a guy behind me say , `` well as is aimee mullins , is . ''
and i turn to my mom and see this elderly gentleman . i had no idea who he is .
and i meant `` sorry , sir , we know ourselves ? i 'm not to you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they appear to do n't remember me .
when i they were first saw , i you in the belly down your mother -- taken . ''
oh , so the .
so obviously has to do it actually click done .
now , dr. <unk> , a guy that i just like narratives of my mother about this day before , because i course , of typically , to my birthday , two weeks late for coming .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was on holiday , and so i knew my parents the man who was born , bringing it , no .
and because i do n't <unk> was born , and my feet up after them pointing had and i just a few toes in this and some toes in other foot felt like he was the <unk> , these strangers to the bad news <unk> .

really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood collected , anyway , if i was in a <unk> in the second grade , i had gained , if i want to get <unk> on parade of <unk> road was , however , if i scholarship or one of cups victories <unk> had , and he used these clips to the students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of <unk> the x factor , the potential human willing .
you ca n't extol to how critical of the factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> talked further , he said `` i learned that kids , if you do n't always something else said , and even if you just some help teachers get to get kids its leaves , can get kids very much for . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has been thinking of changes .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and what someone to handle , two different things are .

i wanted to go back to have normal work .
if you look at this today to ask , i 'm not quite sure .
and that 's happening because i do with my legs , i 've experienced and not even though these experiences .
and perhaps could this change that 's also happen because i was so many people face 'm in my door opened , instead of people to address that i cut or me an idea <unk> wanted .
you see , it really just a person who you demonstrates how one of these forces of manifest can , and they 're going down .
if you find somebody 's possible for his own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do this , and for someone in a critical moment a door up , then you 're for those people are very good teachers .
they teach them on themselves , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' was rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means to produce that in one is , the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential , we hope because now , and retrieve them ?
in the 1960s set out in britain a <unk> done . were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. and call it as `` <unk> . ''
students are going down grades , correlate them .


so obviously <unk> you to the heart to listen to be subverted the <unk> they said , they were just enough .
and similarly , it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones who still in school were -- apart from the students that the school <unk> had .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers not <unk> were .
the teachers did n't think something changed was .
they were just told that are the student and that the students with the note enough . and just put them some trained and you treat .

if we did n't want to create , the human spirit to support to continue to hope to yourself and other people around it nice to find , inquisitive and <unk> to be then put our natural forces genuinely positive .
if a spirit of those qualities , mandate , we can a new reality and new <unk> create .

come to dance with me . thanks .
