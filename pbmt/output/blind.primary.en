yes , good afternoon ladies , gentlemen .
quite so much for inviting me here today to talk .
and i got there right now tell ourselves .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to strange term , <unk> at the city , food .
that 's called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel who second of organization , finally , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and well as you do n't be admired .
i know .
and moreover , and this is something which my son , especially cut down , i have <unk> .
so i 'm the head of <unk> pole .

and have i 'm going to think of course it 's a subject matter , i studied with you today <unk> want .
because of the theme of <unk> , because now this will be pole .
we hope for the best and prepare ourselves on the worst that i 'm here 's what jack quickly see once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i 'm slightly not quite serious to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so we talk , if it as a risk is that we are coming up a disaster , standing , for instance <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
many people are traveling .
it is staring us , it <unk> up .
and somewhere along the edge today 's a suitcase , lonely , leaving , something <unk> , maybe <unk> to stop signs .
nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any subject .
suddenly spawned a <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
police comes , what firemen , <unk> .
people are calling .
officials honking .
they go out .
what 's the world ? say , passersby .
and we know do n't believe or we ca n't say .
people leave the building .
children cry .
some trap and perhaps because there are things rapidly go through .
suddenly , one of gossip .
there 's <unk> this thing .
a panic , breaks down .
i am now here on .
the rest kick me your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy that i was listed have . <unk> ?
this is about this week is happening in dusseldorf .
there 's such a suitcase 're staying .
later turned out that only , in <unk> , nine kilogram of drugs at what they were .
but people were equally , and so a friend mine that tells you , from the building forced .
it did n't say .
and there was singing that of gossip , suddenly , at least in the group at that my friend in my friend of a sophomore .
thank god is n't panic blossomed across , otherwise would run the gloom not so safe exhausted so it seems .
you see , in a <unk> , in encroaching disaster is communication a very important right .
communication is so important because people in this situation is literally for communications <unk> .
they want to know what 's going .
once in the good old was time stands for the authorities , quite simple .
we just have nothing said or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> , there was .
you have to justified to say , god , people get in panic , because i do better not the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of private and public <unk> , in a period of <unk> and public television may not possible .
just and intense that 's why is because it first , not a morally , and second most are , nowadays we have been an administration , the about what happened now .
you may recall one of the <unk> the hudson river , which is , several year of time ago .
one is reporting on that came on twitter .
by somebody who put together on the ferry was and capture and call center immediately <unk> , here 's an airplane <unk> and we save the people now .
this was n't <unk> .
you see , we 're dependent on today , capture and call from <unk> the truth to say , very <unk> to inform .
because usually we 're also the past that supposedly , the truth know , because we and administration of course , really paying attention that we just <unk> information of expertise .
there are public media , or as private media either not so closely held on or they 're just not .
of so , we 're going to eat , and that 's also something that now go through the media have disappeared , we can contemplate what we 're going forward with <unk> deal .
and there 's get the good old siren , then the limits .
however , just a form of <unk> .
so we 're in the years about 100 siren , in the <unk> build that , some of you know about that , <unk> when it 's just to <unk> coming .
used to it .
you may remember what <unk> briefly , once in short , once a long and even just means .
i do n't .
we are the right now being with all <unk> that we at this point , so <unk> , on facebook , through twitter , over the radio <unk> happen overnight , over the tv and all over the internet and the local media and so forth , and immediately connection of course , even with <unk> to end up the information on the elevator .
and we know , we have been very quickly and <unk> operate and we 've been very quickly and <unk> inform because who empower and citizens are otherwise <unk> .
and we finally did n't believe that , what we say choose .
communication in crisis , maybe the disaster is so one , a question of strength of all media that 's look at hand , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
its credibility is our biggest problem because who empower and citizens said , either , yeah , which carried out again , right things do n't , or they say that <unk> us , it 's anything worse than it 's reality is .
we have therefore , too bad experiences has done with facebook and twitter , more recently .
and they have some of with the media collected .
we have a bigger <unk> into food <unk> anyway .
and it 's called a chemical bomb .

the problem is just , many of these suitcase bombs 've never worked and they 're going to the <unk> countries including in food <unk> .
and there were we of an elderly gentleman who will be certain way that it as beautiful in the report says , ultimately , i thought , we 've now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three somebody 's and now <unk> he 'd be the authority that information , there is a bomb -- lies . laughter in the background
way , we 've been be spinning elderly gentleman 's registered in the entire <unk> .
we 'll see what we 'll find everything .
these suitcase bombs that we need immediately the ground , not <unk> , but we will implode be .
and so we then at <unk> park capture and intense an , literally are the word , a bomb exploding on .
and is first in history of the city the whole communicate via facebook and twitter could run with the consequence that the entire <unk> far above <unk> <unk> there followed them .
and the media loved it . laughter in the background .
we did n't even with the phone , but they have <unk> and <unk> , anything about <unk> and twitter .
so they had a great effect for us , because the soundness of being distinct increased about these social media .
just so , you have to me also a sign that matter if i stop them .
i can go from here 's not going to the clock check this .
this is the credibility because first of these social media the advantage we have that you very information of expertise .
not so <unk> are because the members that there to be tweeting right the <unk> how to calls them , a high <unk> have .
secondly , rapid iteration of corrections .
if anything not true , you write it as someone who immediately , so the soundness of which i just talking , i existed over time , because obviously , the whole community in effect on the reports on board is .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if something wrong , then it can also very easy to fix them .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> 're going to get interesting thought , as a bomb on <unk> park up goes .
of so we all of the things that in recent years happened -- , and there are much more <unk> happens when <unk> a more aware when <unk> a white .
also the city of food can see every day of such a disaster home looking up .
a bomb that in implode to be in a park that 's certainly not such a .
but you can also , and then it finding we 're now , in <unk> to find and then i 'm going to sit with our <unk> and try to give in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if they 're going to think about munich , think about other cities , if they will implode of speech , because it just call a <unk> has to get at the conventional n't want to mitigate the horizon , then we know now , be a variety of houses began craving to do n't look like they were .
and that to communicate is important , one , because it 's just in a in a world <unk> <unk> rate is necessary , communication to run by which we also `` i panic , to prevent us to be able to worry about to carry that people getting informed us to be able to worry about to carry that people were able to do , to these difficult situation hiring .

of so now is <unk> not just a task of the authorities , not just a job in north pole , of <unk> , of <unk> , the <unk> , red cross etc. , etc . but communication in the catastrophe and tackle a disaster , walks us of .
and <unk> this has been .
there is through twitter and on facebook , a lot of aid did , though some people are still so overwhelmed with , because suddenly <unk> of people any diking build wanted and you knew nothing more about where the <unk> are .
so this is , there 's even more to do , also for public in communications <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the all around has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a communications -- nothing more way to think there are .
and i hope that i do you some 've convinced that this media , it was supposed to the good stuff of life often is used , in <unk> its sense and purpose and in that we city that for the for the <unk> charge is , this instrument living in the future , here 's really new and very different easily be going to her , to the citizens to rally who empower and citizens and to end i now and <unk> me a welcoming for listening as well , i am the entire time once saw .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , like you just have heard .
and i 'm right now , here 's backed up with my own <unk> to start .
what it is that there i <unk> make me that i 'm here 's a second ago .
before i do this , i have but a few things <unk> .
the first is that , i believe that we stories quite a life needed .
that we do n't need stories about it could live .
and i believe that there are very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are stories , as of the entertainment now actually being produced .
then i do n't know that the internet , the infinite sprawl , of fact , which virtually no <unk> really properly <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> convinced that people that were created , being creative .
and they 'd be happier , as it be creative alike .
the more people are happy , the more focused on this is the world .
very obvious .
these better world is now , however , just a byproduct .
we 're primarily i am , she said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to start looking at midnight , in a bar , in just happy <unk> chanted out into .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get by the <unk> and the when we 're not as much about , because the moment where it at midnight 's gotten , something happens with her .
it something happens in your head , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really words in favor .
they do n't know what 's happening .
i 've now words in favor .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one side <unk> and toto in <unk> and everything is very white .
i got an emotion , i 'm sort <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand we have the two then the trap oz up with very much color .
and it was in this spot once told that i 'd better <unk> and write , when that i draw .
so , the first thing <unk> now with your new perceptions of seeing is an alien man with <unk> <unk> hair , which was she says , you very serious look and say , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> enlightens <unk> about on that they become a special kind of people heard .
she was that this <unk> born .
players are people who were off your <unk> age of their lifetime games have .
who here knows <unk> ?
very beautiful .
imagine that i 'm the immortal at <unk> n't swords , when they intersect , but <unk> from the pocket .
so that cube , <unk> , <unk> , everything .
what really matters , the players have no insight into their play .
we know not , when we die .
i wish that every a long life but we do n't just not .
it could tomorrow also all already been over .
and power is it in my players are so .
you know nothing to what you , because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost minute could the last been .
a player , of his entire lifetime playful enough , <unk> the moment of <unk> like a candle that <unk> will .
now it 's a natural wonder , if it because this is dangerous , why games are then place ?
the answer is clearly , this .
without play , without any players around you , <unk> , all of gray and just as a player does that 's actually being alive .
they were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you go through the world of the players <unk> to make their first challenge is and of course it gives in <unk> love , which is the story that i tell you .
and in some form a <unk> .
the first season has 12 to follow , sorry , i came up here a <unk> happens that i just too late 've seen .
so , twelve follow the first season at length of each spent five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence for the other , beautiful <unk> told that you know .
the television sets for his <unk> anything else .
this is not news .
and if it all be , about something like `` i now , first case closed .
and also not calling yourselves .
now is it but first races .
we go to get to <unk> back .
what 's the most famous set of the film and of the show ?
it can only a matter , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that would .
now that comes in my players actually not too .
of which is it 's very many senses .
there are so many different games .
just think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth and so forth .
and equally <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and power lies at a bunch of stories that all be told by choice .
now if the next question : who 's this because all share ?
i got ta carry a very high think of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficient intelligent and the most imaginative .
but i know that 's hundreds of brains more produce as only one , even though it mine is .
so it got straight to the idea that you the crowd out in the creative process itself .
what if we <unk> not just tolerate or give them , but even <unk> ?

imagine that i 'm like the result three shows a <unk> on that you really neat to find , because it takes them for example of her grandfather mind .
and you 're a big fan of <unk> .
they can now , it with the present technology is it 's nothing more so hard to a <unk> do .
and this store them on the <unk> up , where it right now , which is that really cool <unk> , which really interested in the audience , gaining will .
so , it 's not anywhere among them , but it lands automatically be exactly where they get them .
this really nice is that we the internet is .
and the web and you ca n't really do anything .
so , every medium is that sense that allows .
so you a viewer you can write , drawing , turn , whatever they do want .
and if we also now again this structure to see .
it looks <unk> out <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , which together built into .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced that the internet was born , in fact of this kind of stories .

but anyway , go `` i but even one step further and i leave the viewer in touch the players are .
because in a <unk> .

phrases anticipating that you 've also informs all a very well , are sort of mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
these amazing areas that are very rapidly evolve .
and on the i do n't develop software , because i used to make another two minutes would need .
we conceive of all together .
everybody 's time other pairs of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second piece is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
so this <unk> i could actually manufacture the jury of that moment , i 've got this quickly see : the <unk> innovation <unk> persuade .
they get me the first prize for the best business in history .
and i have to say , the judges consisted of officials from the banks , from the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so good people , you should say .
and when i want to convince you , here with my : the internet right to use , <unk> structures revolutionize medicine , incidentally , even better world , then i think , i can actually get everybody convinced .
so .
everybody 's time off , why does all right now that ?

we have of course , once the <unk> , who 's think that i think that you 're off , everybody 's time off .
obviously the company to die .
in the sequence is very much , died .
everybody 's time off means : everyone needs to die .
and then also , everybody 's time off in terms of you can all agree , if you want .
this is i really important .
i 'll get 'em from <unk> and there 's nothing worse in my opinion , as if it a <unk> will .
i do n't know if you know .
if you in theater , and then the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please do n't me .
and this is n't hiring .
so it 's volunteer interaction .
and nobody has to .
it can also just watching this .
the reason i german , talking about is that the entire project of german , it 's first place .
and it has a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while , along and i was kept asking : go through the entire but in english , demographic bigger , blah blah .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then the spanish , and then the german .
it 's so now not that it 's like us in some little flecks of exercise .
furthermore think i really quite clearly , if it also other people that 's like me that people would be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was where the end up every <unk> and each of wordplay <unk> has been .
if it all that 's how dare i 'd like , it 's one is happening now on the first <unk> <unk> online .
and when they are going to ask why i because now here i 'm doing a <unk> where it under the headline <unk> <unk> <unk> 's going .
and i 've also some thoughtful done .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also pretty sensitive to <unk> and <unk> .
some <unk> were also along and <unk> .
and i can really just say that all of knowledge incredibly important is , and fabulously <unk> .
but it 's using all of nowhere , when you do n't apply it .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just going to everything we have what i was so we 've learned .
and it applied this .
and have never runs a 's good .
i can really just say .
so when i might be someone is thinking i want to have been my bit contribute , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i got <unk> drawing <unk> cartoon , or whatever that 's already .
you find us to be an online .
on facebook .
great , like releasing the speaker to talk .
yes , <unk> `` i get too .
welcoming welcome to : you can imagine memory delete it ?
question for them .
you can imagine memory delete it ?
they can go because of all remember what to your life ever happened ?
they 've got <unk> mention ?
who has who can even at all remind you ?
it goes `` no one hand up .
so you can imagine memory delete it ?
so it turns out .
so much .
no , so easy to let 's us today ca n't do .
it runs the talk today probably fairly quickly .
again a good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the speeches tonight , the i 've chosen , because he 's two of my passions , or my two great passions currently together .
i got up here close to the computers studied and got me just showed up with bits and bytes busy , the right now as tall by the world to fly .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach and adviser during the private and vocational field transit .
on the one hand — i so with the with the computer a very busy , on the other hand , i 'm currently working in the inside the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that it 's the human beings ?
how do you because that change ?
the to get an indication figuring out .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , <unk> intelligence .
so , the question was , when we can , when , when we can build a computer , the way it works like the human brain ?
so , and i <unk> ' there we already quite close .
so i think about these two , three hundred years , longer need to do n't .
but let me give freedom , why you why that maybe <unk> bit needs .
so the analogy between your computer on the one hand and our brains to the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based on , everything , so your smartphone that you tablet , you <unk> and of these cameras and all those smart refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he called the cpu , central <unk> <unk> .
these pieces are completely composed of tiny transistors .
the word has surely does anyone heard and in <unk> it will always get a triangle spaces .
this <unk> little device that has three <unk> and turn appropriately current through , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i got some extra <unk> about five hundred million this little pieces .
and the gears here is rampant mess .
we hold on things that we we calculate the things that we have degrees ' `` albert einstein told you hear , yes , 'n computer can all can be very much , very quickly , but actually he can just zero and one compare .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite sucks .
let 's time you compare with our brains .
our brain has been called the smallest unit of the neuron , the nerve and we do you know , there too , i <unk> a hundred billion , so hundred billion neurons are in our gray of mass up here in there .
the beauty and is that we do your neurons have not only three connections , but they have to <unk> each neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it beautiful , was 10 trillion .
these are tens of 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , there 's what you have the complexity of the brain is so much higher than what we probably more than with computers .
we want to <unk> by contrast , maybe the one or other conditions of the first supercomputer that their own powerhouse next-door to stand , ha the <unk> , and with its the <unk> was the campus , there <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes , but the box up here takes about 20 watts .
and this is and this is about the equivalent of two big selling bananas , which is more you do n't and doing their computer up there 's wonderful .
if we go <unk> <unk> good part up here , <unk> <unk> great computers with <unk> , why we use the , why forget we then things ?
maybe you know the one or other kinds of ads on internet , so , the man using only 10 percent of his brain , buy them now this <unk> for <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> being wrong , the marketing is a little .
ten percent less , perhaps , but our brain is so throughout our evolution into this mass a result , it was <unk> smaller , regardless of center 's still our <unk> with this thing , everything else has <unk> building .
that 's probably not happen , because we do n't use .
why it seems to e : so that we the most part of <unk> do ?
maybe you know the notion of the unconscious ?
the i based on the more and so nice to the iceberg , if you the iceberg , and see in the ocean , then is ' 's up the top , then the surface , the bottom is a <unk> .
and these 10 percent above , which is that 's about what our <unk> , our <unk> mind is , <unk> going but <unk> percent , is a giant <unk> down , <unk> .
we <unk> the point we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow <unk> we <unk> creative .
and , to pull <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people who spontaneously on a lot more detail to remind you can when i do n't seen got about in the situation <unk> , and the tell you <unk> , i got said yes , but i would but where you know that ?
it works , there 's very , there 's a particular , we call a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody 's mostly in a field <unk> who had excellent is , who has a so good <unk> memory , who 's been in an airplane , on , in an airplane , in a helicopter , so fast is ' he then ow do n't , over rome effectively went to have to rome to view , so rome 's right now ow do n't necessarily the smallest city , has been subsequently got a gigantic signs , leaf tied to help and has begun to rome to draw .
and it does n't somehow , so this river , and there is about this , no , every single house , every single door , and each window has been seen , he has <unk> , it could go back to paper , right ?
why is now this ?
so why ca of this , why ca n't we , well , the presumption , is perhaps pretty close that the <unk> bit more access to his <unk> percent <unk> has .
now we use the yes , but why i can not going to look at the <unk> night , remember , in all the details that ?
'n <unk> <unk> of mine has to be interesting experiences has done .
he said , for example in the <unk> worked so , and with a rape and worked , who had her experience that is completely eliminated that was not present , the <unk> <unk> by the brain , that 's not happening , that 's gone .
wonderful , so i came the very clear .
now went 's , but about people <unk> to make .
there 's got them in a very safe session , at the end or after this event earlier , can also when they are no more active -- remember that could be able to you then the hallmark of the car see where these people <unk> that was not there going to the state their 40s meters down .
and indeed , with the hallmark of the man would ensue been .
so what i was pretty cool found was , he did a lady in those cases hypnosis had that has told that her mother helped her father used to alice in wonderland , reading , when she was little bit , and four years .
there was reading them on my lap her mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he then she said , into urban trance , pushing the time ago .
it has started <unk> , she was four times than that happened , you could then there 's not going to read today can do you .
and then you have said he said , tell me put the <unk> .
they actually have a specimen from alice in wonderland found , where right in this side of text it said , the that lady , reading about .
the brain has so this page as it was <unk> , as a picture .
afterwards she could read .
so yes , we actually have access them , but we seem as the normal life . say <unk> kind <unk> to have to do n't feel to <unk> .
now to store , we might not that event itself , but how <unk> have said , he 's a kind of a picture thing is a , a a <unk> , we can store , rather , our data , so what we see , what we smell , what we hear , what we taste and what we feel , hey , as you <unk> at a yellow lemon think and how she 's really <unk> <unk> , they <unk> it felt like the taste , very <unk> example .
and it was now <unk> long last night , they make but <unk> comfortable down , ha , <unk> more sustained and as if you can i asked them to conclude , you just a comment on their eyes .
and remember on a welcomed , positive event in the recent past , yes .
take the first thing happens .
and when they do now , you might notice that you to this memory involving a visual part up .
they get maybe a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some land that 's not only on , because we do so normally do , but they do this first occurred .
and if you see that , you can be , either you in the movie , from your eyes , all experience , or as you can see themselves on a canvas .
this one 's call <unk> , the other <unk> .

who 's because a visual information can get by hand ?
yeah , there 's go chase <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's like to shoot 'n third or so i would say , yes , that 's about what i expected to do it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it gives us from the first time we are not sure .
well , make 'em <unk> on .
<unk> matter what 's beautiful , all sorts of memories , if you false memories <unk> , does n't just that memory up , <unk> <unk> feel empowered , we <unk> a positive event and i got the one or other babies smile can see , there was so yes , it was fine , there was , yes , you laugh , and there 's the memory , maybe there , actually save us with our memories from most beautiful or other feelings that .
and here 's what 's exciting .
<unk> everything was yes , well , which our brain power of the spot , no difference between what we actually looks like , and what we just imagine what we have conceived .
so is you can try , if you look at home <unk> down and i do something in the future , imagine that had never happened , they 're similar information put like something , if you look at something remember what the last time .
and that , you know , but surely those stories that you look like a story in <unk> round of years ago .
then , hey , there is that happen and that , and that was so beautiful , and the longer a story <unk> , the beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot of drunks , there was the evening , even more <unk> , there was the sun 's even more romantic , there was the waterfall is much higher .
keep going to have to retrospectively do , so if we really our memories so change , why do this because not touch , i asked them ?
<unk> when i came to have my uncle an image showing , from his hut in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful hut .
just , the picture is ' <unk> bit of beautiful as the shack , so it 's artistic freedom , he made me explain , well there 's the shack <unk> bit in production , there is ' 'n little more of grass just before , there 's a gorgeous dog in front , there is radiated the sun at the alps , this is viewed a picture of the shack , not going to make .
and why do that 's not using our own thoughts , our memories , hey , and that bothers me of because when i of this beautiful , taking on what i degrees think ?
they actually have art of liberty in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know that some people who are they 're seeing the morning , if you just so in embodied have eyes , what 's the world ?
so i got bad slept , i was all the <unk> through the head .
really all night and this idea made me stop being wrong .
i think it’s round of he made the idea not going .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he had to germany was because his mother in <unk> stayed and he did you just terrible missed .
what 's father 's done , so he has every night with his son <unk> and said , or has been wondering , so what was because the nicest , which has happened ?
what was because the nicest , tell time , and then he kept telling me , has it <unk> as well , it just tell me , what today is an amazing happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son <unk> .
and then it was ok , that the ma way that 's coming again , to visit .
and the is this the has this all the kind of done with which is today one of <unk> people who i know .
so there 's not the memories , which we can influence in which is how we are , but it 's our focus on our focus on what you think we use .
and how much energy we 'll add wasting or convenience .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , which was today now ow , this is so , <unk> this practice ' and i do n't want to you make it -- to sink way to do you might tom cruise in this <unk> fiction . he put this , that these <unk> computers where he did the files <unk> <unk> , they do but also time , they look at your picture that <unk> of this , well not quite amazing have one , they say , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happening now , bam , way through .
so ham ' we because <unk> ' yet , ah , what i have never , yes look out there , <unk> , yeah it made me <unk> ' real love , gee , that was that was fine , what ?
and then you take that sink in .
take this to in your <unk> and let 's <unk> .
or if you find somebody <unk> irritates you , <unk> to be it <unk> their your boss , or your spouse , or her husband , <unk> , they laugh <unk> .
so , put this again this picture , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let 's in the background horses jump , yes , you laugh , why they laugh ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these ideas are funny .
and you have much better deal with a sudden deal .
ca man memories so delete it ?
no , i think our brain has been so much capacity that there anything can hold .
it does nothing , because we can go to vote , how much we going to focus and how important it 's an event , a memory , a thought to rate , it comes up at us .
my <unk> in yourself , of them , they play with the images into your head , you to use the power of <unk> and they give him every day <unk> to enrich your life .
ok. good afternoon .
thanks for the invitation .

if i then <unk> that it 's where festival by a festival in classical music is , sweep of those dancing <unk> pictures of old people who were just as long <unk> in <unk> space would sit and very focused in art , listen .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is like about architecture to dance .
and similarly is literally acting it also with what we do .
so they still a glimpse into what i 'll talk , i asked them a short film , brought .
movie .
<unk> is something roll <unk> it .
this is it me looked at best at the place .
since <unk> growing the <unk> from the <unk> lust , learned something completely different to make .
we makers have today is something between eighteen , and middle , over 20 old and have an early in our youth actually experienced that make phenomenal strength and delight us understand classical music <unk> .

and we 're in solid belief that we call the crisis the classical music not to the content , so on the music self , but it on their <unk> about .
so i would be the question , how do we have a <unk> create that the music the front of the friends and this power back there is that way that we really about it like .
how do we have a <unk> organize that goes beyond the conventions of <unk> work ?
we put these parameters which you from the classical concert , about space , time , light , the context , basically this question .
so for example , the relationship between audiences , and musicians .
usually have between the stage and the audiences a gulf .
we try to repealing .
you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians sitting in the audience , drink beer , and entertain , in the breaks up with audiences , you get up to play a , two pieces , plunk yourself back in the audience .
all this is the course of the night a little <unk> .
anyone who feel i did <unk> to come on the stage and goes back .
and sit in the concert .
in classic concert , as it is you have to sort comfortable , permanent chairs , kind of -- you guys , sitting in front look and listening .
there are but music , because you ca n't actually silently sit .
and we 've thought i did it as you can do n't work .
if you differently and sitting in a <unk> play music <unk> can you 'll hear them automatically either way .
yet there 's that we at the concert does n't a stage , but four of arenas for the audience around .
the audience could no , <unk> .
so i was sitting on the night every once in front .
important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the sounds of thinking .
that we 're so questions that spaces and the atmospheres around but also in the mind of the people need the music , that they are able to how they seem to ?
and then they performing at nighttime to <unk> o'clock in 30 in <unk> , the s actually just by <unk> lit up , in clubs , on <unk> , in old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around and the illumination can music literally alive now into and we 're now , but the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that 's been a few years with <unk> work together , to us dances , or movement to music to <unk> going to do n't turning to dance been written about .
and then they <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> by steve rich .
and so this year we 've got , yes , if you will , <unk> accomplished .
we have the first time a concert , together with <unk> implemented .
we have the story of soldiers of <unk> <unk> to act , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> all together .
it 's mostly also about this works , because we do a big <unk> had to us in this song is backed her .
we have a <unk> much money from people involved in germany , we got so that we do <unk> could .
anyway , those festival something that from a community figured out another .
we 're totally happy in the near <unk> in a sliding <unk> a home found for .
the city in fact , just as big that 's great physical spaces and exciting place for performing find , but also as small that we 'll notice .
if beginning of the year , we released , two weeks forty <unk> from all around europe in the city , then drops on just that in the city more people with <unk> walk when you normally .
the whole festival is <unk> organization .
we makers have a smorgasbord of students and students , medieval doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally be completely mixed .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> which so the <unk> and coordination , and funding in the eye can keep , <unk> to seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , who is for a year bind the task over .
while also <unk> , but they care for a year about that for example that <unk> or the <unk> that <unk> in solid hands are and to festival get organized .
we do all of leisure and live across the germans distributed .
so , most of the work comes <unk> and on a <unk> .
just three times per year we come together about this year that defuses into an extended weekend , <unk> to discuss the one or other problems that appeared , and cultivate this also interpersonal together , it just amazing thing , if you should have to moving , keeping me .
for festival , even come by two decades until thirty thousand volunteers workers to treat the be a few days or a few weeks hence their hands going to bring that 's the gel where some sort of being used to <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and naturally within this 14 days from the musicians to .
now you could mean , to do we have all you for such a festival needs .
but our <unk> goes on .
we have stepped into <unk> in the city a large community around us are made sense , which were backed by what we do .
it goes from the classic <unk> go , it 's also about very practical things like the <unk> , we have a baker , of us to bread <unk> or a <unk> who were fresh food can give place .
this <unk> going into barnes in the city there about all year done and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a bunch of private found that allow us their living rooms are available so that the musicians out of samples of .

they relate to get involved in a very peculiar way with this festival .
since the beginning of the year we could very much <unk> support of the citizens on site an <unk> in calls that now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable <unk> place .
we makers of the stage believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly excited about that throughout europe young musicians played music in their own destinies and home at yourself in cities <unk> hold .
when they 're still not really can imagine how is peaceful , classical music as to see that we come up , you just over .
start next year we go back in <unk> and we 'd like us happy , if you also there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you think it may know him .
know that belongs to learning to or the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning is much more , which was also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
knowledge even experience once <unk> to a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
i sort of art and culture 've learned , now , because i can actually a lot of course of saying , because now ar <unk> <unk> i mean in this field .
and so i think that maybe it right , think that something <unk> called a different <unk> have to give you what my talk <unk> .
art is nice to do so much work .
they now have laughed .
you get progressively from laughs , though most of the phrase usually happens .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word pretty as something <unk> what we not really capture this .
art , say that we also that sometimes has whatever .
to work . say this rare that 's what .
sometimes it .
the people who 'd like to work that 's what to me .
but at work think we tend to the <unk> and where the arts kind of the realm beyond the everyday , where we look inside the detector , our experiences are collecting , our own thoughts or whatever .
and so i mean <unk> that i can you now recite want , in about three hours in five different sections shared that all the headline to have a i start to make it for you very simple is .
it starts with the <unk> , for childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , then go ahead , the word age-grade explain me afterwards , why i 'm going to my <unk> taken this .
the interaction with the first part of my vocational life and finally , fifth , of identification .
<unk> one chimp is this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian 's bach know .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , if you can reasonably practice , and i 've gotten somewhat practicing .
and so with 10 , 11 , i met these little bits in the game , on piano , so far from here , at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a tune in the game and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm , which is equal , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in the art , it succeeds , and if it just two votes are , <unk> together , together to think whether that the present , the future , the past , sometimes it 's where they actually works , images , in <unk> , my mom plays , things that <unk> 're working on the moment the way , that gives art from .
and i 've been taught me , two distinct melodies , sometimes it three , in the <unk> <unk> , in addition to play , any sense , but to hear that came to highlight , the other not .
it was the , what i 've learned , among other .
another experience i 've never forget and i put the job anyway , that it me today may be going to be .
i piano <unk> , there were more people in the hall over here today , and in the middle <unk> i came out .
i had forgotten .
i memorized played .
so again from scratch and started and at the same spot , i did was no more .
the audience did n't have sweated so much as i , because i walked in all quiet on my place , brought my notes , i put them down and started the third time from scratch .
and you think it 's not how to me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very tough experience .
maybe it was also one of experience where i 'm going to know , well , with the piano , although i 'll quickly a <unk> had , i should n't perhaps my <unk> go , because to talk to be easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean <unk> of inspiration and also because i want to tell stories .
when i left so <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , like to mr. <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver that 's not .
i mean , you very many <unk> visited , and very much experience with women raised all have .
now imagine time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , such a sentence .
the i obviously not forget .
and from there i kind of course , even more practicing .
now i was actually now and time in a <unk> .
i practicing and i remember a situation that i so no longer have experienced .
it was the <unk> of <unk> by chopin and now i get to the part of work , i have a job simply not earth , and she was with the nicest place , very broad you need to the poor do , and then the back together and back apart .
i can now unfortunately , not going to play , is not a piano here , and i could it does n't .

and then i keep them playing and <unk> , i gave me in a <unk> played , and i know it only that i suddenly on the ground <unk> and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to admit , not taken , and the music has this with me to be done .
an experience where i 've learned , emotions , actually have to occur .
and sometimes it 's also true , we have to work that you in this <unk> <unk> , in that condition , i call it time , of <unk> .
where all of themselves involved .
we had this situation in fact , then in <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we the <unk> made , the only half months taken , where we usually a half years for would need .
well , they were my experiences with the piano , with art , absolute being artistic work .
and now i get to my student , age-grade system .
i was first of a musician in transit , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> played , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> gave , and i gave me because so complete alongside my <unk> for the music to engage you can and that <unk> anyway .
in choir singing , together to breathe a <unk> singing , amazing experiences that reminded me very , on enriched my own .
and then one point where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> gone up , in the <unk> and the governance , and i have the result of an age-grade <unk> , this chapter , because there 's me this incursion came , or see this idea that came from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> also starting in the <unk> place , politics and law a career making .
because the art , culture for people , to my <unk> to make .
so here working for the art , but you do n't as artists , but otherwise , you would n't say <unk> , but as <unk> <unk> and keep doing something .
i was there in theater and got interested <unk> , there was in germany , never <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there , i am i did , and from there have i do n't care with this issue , what you can do to art might be able to improve our constraint , for art to improve them to say a management , a good and civics and lately ?
and that was the reason why i 'm going to do n't stop 'm in my career , towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years turned out , i then <unk> .
but it was another <unk> , and this phase i mean <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in <unk> born with , and says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about <unk> me , i have to somehow this time <unk> .

and i was a little bit more something that i do n't really enjoyed actually , and suddenly i was sucked into a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture that lived by people in this in this <unk> there 's <unk> .

and i went to <unk> <unk> , the future financial and <unk> <unk> , of my friend and colleague , because we would be able to <unk> night made music , he had guitar , i piano , yet another was being basses played , like he could then i memorized <unk> .


it was my destiny , i get the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't look at that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yes .
i 'm just flip prepared to any questions for <unk> .
and down here i was trustee of the cities in the east germany .
and so i went back to you how to interact with interactions taking place between two german culture .
it 's talk the same language , the music is also on wonderful and have been great game , but driven by <unk> , <unk> .

since is germany , yes <unk> .
since is also on the <unk> much more <unk> places .
interaction , i then , but all things here 's learned and experienced , in the city food .
we have of <unk> that i had actually a <unk> , imagine that time ago when i 'll see here he began to <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i have the left .
their leisure time stands for <unk> , you did n't write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was going to the first ceo of <unk> .
so i play is not much so , anyway , it was wonderful , that i was <unk> had , but she disappeared soon , because i 'm going to learning in charge and was going to make alliances with me to education , and you make before .
we have very much for the <unk> done , we have the if you just put this simple analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see what we designed , the <unk> see that we <unk> where your interactions between works and architecture can find great , from <unk> to <unk> at the blue stones .
, many interactions , we could and i could create , and i 've experienced , and they noted , what this as different people in different fields together a vision tracking .
you get the way that i do n't <unk> of the art , and more to culture that 's mind that have a unifying between people , between cultures , between community , better way , into view , and i come but later on the storytelling moment .
interaction , she was then put between <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea that were at <unk> january <unk> that <unk> might look at the <unk> europe promote .
but this last chapter , at the fifth chapter one has yet the headline of identification .
this word was two senses , for one , i misimpression by using something , <unk> me now to something , and i can also as verb use and say , i misimpression something that means , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know about suppressing its <unk> , so i say , i misimpression you or the right , that community .
and i misimpression by using something , if i 'm going to <unk> and say , that belongs to me , with whom i want to identify .
and that 's a big action that point .
five point three million people to try to move , <unk> cities , to identify the double sense , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we 're going <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people who in a big <unk> life and yet at least a common language to talk , even though <unk> nations are and this was our <unk> of identification to initiate for the men and one of course , too much ride .
at the signs of americans , <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> did n't have so many people to catch .
so ham 's <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , collaborating , young girl from <unk> , one of <unk> , and young kids come from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letter of people , young men , from <unk> to play process , the home , goodbye , dear , death , the last letter writing about .
and it was a special effect that young girl letters of young <unk> <unk> and young russians out letters of young men from germany in something <unk> german .
and then set up one of young men the piano and played this <unk> that i think so loved .
and at oh , you 've been quoted him from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him home , as young german , the he played , and i can no longer a <unk> play , because my my two fingers exactly <unk> are .
and he <unk> your fingers off with <unk> , set up again the piano in that play on <unk> carl , trying to the <unk> to play .
and it could it does n't .
it was for me as a <unk> scene , i 'm looking forward , jumped -- i said , what we 've actually learn ?

and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , you 're trying to learn not just about something to know .
it 's trying to learn more about having an experience and <unk> to gain .
and if we much create and invention to let <unk> , if we let it , we should be inspired an art and culture , our own position to include , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact , and inevitably of our own identity , keep working , we move in art and culture question , and then we 've won
and i hope that you a lot of <unk> and <unk> have from which you those profit to move .
so much .
yes , very much .
i think we wait on the first picture of thing .
so i want to <unk> support my memory is such a few slides <unk> .
it 's no science of the slides , but it 's in my <unk> here about a way to find and me with a theme unthread that where i think that we 're the next 15 years to be much either .
by the <unk> words i know now finally , very much for what ted 's also means , and i think in terms <unk> we can this talk really categorize it .
and then i had heard that you to talk , in english felt when a way possible , but if you to look , you see , you would n't understand what i in english to say , i knew why not directly , what i was a moment and so i want to talk , then all of german , there .
how we shall die .
so let them there first of <unk> tell you .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital where i the <unk> <unk> , and was the ground .
she was about <unk> years old and has always interested in may , yeah , because it 's also to her husband is reminded of the first man who in war fallen out .
and so she 's a year in the first of may be a dance , you go and has long , yeah , and probably even then a <unk> <unk> too much to admit , and then is ground and has , here at the right-hand side you see this , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years ago was actually ever ground and has been on the same way , with the same reason , before the left leg gets broken .
and then i was at that there as a doctor and i 've seen how you weeks on the icu was about how it to antibiotics was treated , resurrects was , and have the discussion figure out how they said , is because that any sense ?
it makes any sense , in such ancient people like this intense procedure use to get ?
so speaking to <unk> , in the icu weeks , that 's a people ever <unk> ?
and it is fixed the '50s .
five years later -- i get into the clinic to see the name <unk> , and the can i 'll notice , because he just so rare is also for the time ago , so , and look at a parish dance with you may be back the other one leg gets broken .
it turns the question what <unk> i was actually when i talk about this talk , as a person to choose to do you want to what it in bearing her directives , writes or what he also to <unk> <unk> ?
and that 's as a kind of the subject of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> 's called how we shall die .
it 's a book out of <unk> how we 're going to a report on the <unk>
and then it was so that globalization is very first went to be so you remember asking me , how do it because we 're going to be connected to work ?
you have then , and talk about in this book now , here read , just said , it 's a <unk> get done to the parts of getting together .
it 's a networking of working our successes , it 's also the work much more and overseas , like to china , this was a big issue .

and that , after my sense that humans screw and fewer confidence from their work , there could and increasingly , in a little <unk> were , where there 's why i went to write these sky high <unk> to reach , and not more about through his work itself out to define .
and keep going to carry on the <unk> and medical field , then there 's obviously just as a trend .
if you on television to hear what doctors , nurses and also <unk> most likely to lawsuits , then it 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there 's cctv by what you did this to <unk> is so it ever paid , and if not being documented , says the health service also `` that care or that medical treatment should pay we do n't .

a great friend of mine is now in holland , you go , because he said this is not wanted somebody who had a <unk> practice , has actually discarded , is from holland , you go to doctor for <unk> of this .
the <unk> are with those big developments , most of a piece forward and he who is martin , had just experienced that became more old people commute between <unk> , hospital , there and back because the <unk> n't know what they do when it 's the people bad job ended .
you have the hospital , is restored to go back into <unk> , or <unk> , and going on that care .
and this <unk> was just wondered if it should have to pay in holland , then i want to be like to train a real time to something here advancing that you from this cascade of <unk> and it 's also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there now , in holland got to he actually realize , after having the language with trying much learned had learned that there , exactly what happened , what about this <unk> happened .
it 's also trying to die increasingly a <unk> introduced .
it 's no longer the credibility that counts , but you put even in a technology on tap ; i want to take it was resuscitated , or not a hospital , but i look at <unk> am .
and then becomes the <unk> .
in holland , as it , the third day , finds a conversation with the admitted , instead , and they 're going to go to settle , i want a hospital or i want to stop being a hospital , if i could happen .
the same way to , i want resuscitated , or i do n't it resurrects be .
this data , then drift up a central and there sits in the doctor for <unk> , has always the <unk> to go and hits then the decision on this base .
so , going to <unk> <unk> that 's like to the may , yeah , and also look at ground , and imagine ourselves that would eventually a directives , written i would n't resuscitated , it would those two , dance in may be in the may , where you going back the ground is , admittedly , no longer to experience .
and this raises my friend now , who 's in holland , reciting a very much <unk> , right up to deal with them .
last it 's so that <unk> today about <unk> to seventy percent of people stop at home to die , but in hospitals , that institutions , and that these institutions are also `` , so you can make sense , not the ideal habitat of old people , but it 's often a tightly financially closely <unk> <unk> there , the <unk> are often <unk> and the developing in and of look at this <unk> find there , after my experience , restricted to find .


this is today just not the fact , but it requires two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly comes to do it has even close .
this introduction of <unk> as a result is constantly growing a market that you manage to , does that we could rely on the individuals concerned enough .
and now i get to do something that maybe you can escape , so what we are the past , because i did n't put them questions , and leaves , so easy is the situation for affected n't .
and so i just going to the <unk> <unk> and this paper one myself in <unk> , because i think a society will take the time structures , whether or legal structure , where we all the <unk> what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article one is hiring architects who would of people 's <unk> .
and the second set up there is , you to protect is supreme task of <unk> .
and what i often lacking is another third set in there is , because each other level of making a charter to have to his going to protect and to defend .
because it a way is , their own free from this case , i realize that from other way and the supposed to me just kind of a mentor , and feed and then i needs to me <unk> no idea about doing , like me because even die with me .
because the last is it turns out , but that even when we look at the subject does n't like to imagine that we will eventually graduated from the point of tomorrow .
hopefully later , with a century or <unk> .
the size of course , my career as well , to say that i wish everyone around and since i want you can the way , but eventually gets you look at the subject would have , and if you know , maybe as far does or even if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it can already late in life to be late in life be to say , i want about this question now even think .
now if you think about what makes my 'd like , and you are on things come to come up in that has come out , which is because essentially the five major things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , eliciting quite <unk> <unk> is .
it 's the self-esteem of course , there are then the friends that i have in which i 'm talking and exchange can who know me and the me through life be part , there are the <unk> .
it 's certainly the trust between people , i 've had been maybe to do have , in <unk> or in <unk> area or a pastor or a <unk> or just inspecting other people , i 've had to relate to put it .
and there are there 's many individual factors of course , that there <unk> , i presume that 's not all around .

and then there yet another factor in that we have a sense of dictatorship of <unk> experience , i did this one another way as a text , as an example is taken .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , what 's <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would only can make ourselves to come out .
so it 's not the question , what do because others to me do , who gets me because even provide , care or to me again , who goes up to me ?

and if you and says , how we work , so we have been occupying this <unk> that gives the outside of put down , it 's an opportunity to say , i <unk> me about my my inner would , this mechanism to escape .


these questions that i can last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> them .
this would of people 's an internal mindset that in me , looking at is not from outside of pedagogy can that the state is not can protect them , even a law , and the me by other people <unk> can and i 'd rather <unk> , if i 'm just go on themselves before we have to <unk> have 've done to them also know what i think is a man was .
and to produce these conversations to lead , we need a sort of spaces , and since i think , and why i this talk so called , and here -- very disturbed , are those spaces like this <unk> in the food , i 've already here have both of trying to a picture times <unk> , spaces where we over these issues you think of course , where a protected space is , so it does n't hurt is that it may not being analyzed theoretically , but that they just make a conversation changes page is happening .
so we , if we 're old , really can say , oh , such a dance with you may , despite my may very high age that was once more thing .
thank you welcoming for listening .
beautiful good evening .
i pull two things with .
if you the first part of flat , they make a little <unk>
it comes to be a second .
we start with infinite number of them .
this is stupid , not , can accomplish .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is infinite enough ?
yes !
this is not good if this one is , of what looks .
so , in fact , but i nutshell , it down , for those who know it .
this is what we do n't .
we employ us with just one .
and i frontier that puts a little take off a finite .
<unk> , finite we know , boundless we educate ourselves a to know .
and it 's for the <unk> to take orders of sets .
if we call a finite along those are , and add two <unk> , in one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , given that already , we looked at the box in , the number is small , it 's three : chairs and it 's three people .
we can we check whether , in any of the same amount of other elements in there is ?
they count how would we do ?
so , we would get the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three : chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and beautifully .
that you mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in a finite wonderful to work it also very large numbers , although it sucks .
but it does .
how do you just count ?
how do you 'll check that so many people like chairs are there ?
i realized the chairs and people down and not what else .
<unk> make !
you call a mate .
you well , that it 's obvious , not , and we 're in the ground in transit and even understand that includes all .
not that 's very beautiful .
so , we call it as a professional , a <unk> and it works like , yeah ?
you take a , putting them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , out , the next <unk> , it 's operating , different people get different chairs , not a chair , but empty and the amount of these same size , okay ?
now we go out of inexhaustible .
how do you two infinite sets compare these ?
we would say that came to the size or more or less than the other .
we could we do it ?
we 'd return to start .
right , it 's wrong because the point is the , if you in an infinite to reach for quantity actually start to count , yes , i would n't just say they are not to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so , how 's ?
madame ?
uh-uh , `` madame .
they did n't know it 's just that really started .
mate .
but anyway , let 's what happens .
estimate , estimate is an infinite always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is this , you do it very simple .
if i 'd like the <unk> guess , natural numbers , <unk> , we <unk> need to zero in the beginning to zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we could , let 's put , a xerox that <unk> and take on the copy the infinity many <unk> pay off .
left to be the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
every line numbers are <unk> on the infinitely long line across the natural numbers , but on a string up the <unk> , on others are the line and the <unk> it , okay ?
we call the a lot , g keep the straight numbers , we call the other lot n , the natural numbers .
what you believe ?
is g more powerful , it 's bigger than n , same size or smaller ?
same size ?
it 's very underlie his , yes , where you want to know the <unk> .
who has another estimate ?
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , which was really absolutely no plan , yeah ?
so , it 's not be , yeah ?
you ca n't mean , where what do not detected , that wo n't , <unk> ?
okay , they go smaller ?
you would suspect , right ?
this is the normal , what you also suspected of course it 's wrong .
and now , and now i 'll let me why the sets are alike .
how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of the way , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next of zero , plus two is two to zero does the one , and i can get another <unk> .
the four , the two that six , the three that eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that we want to invert , then it 's doubling , it 's obvious , <unk> ?
and completely clear , through the <unk> do it that i do it always in the lecture such a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just straight on and the band is equally long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural history of the line , <unk> that <unk> are out and the band is still same length .
it 's just an infinite .
so if you some explain what we have learned to have become infinity learned , yes , what 's infinite , i know just finally ?
an infinite amount has a property that 's a finite n't hiring testing and this trait , which is , is absolute <unk> a true , subset of the same size is .
that they make a finite not when you are three three people , two people <unk> , it 's only one there and previously were about three .
yeah , this , we hold infinity is done .
is none <unk> ?
okay .
then we make a second part of probability .
the professionals , <unk> probability .
i 'll see what brought .
with this experiment i 'm sure that , interestingly , least one third know and <unk> it does someone with that it gets us , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything hidden , i hope you have n't heard .
and they should now starting to guess .
where , you mean , i was something hidden , behind a , b , or c ?
to guess here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate at c .
who got another idea ?
a ?
who got another idea ?
<unk> , <unk> , b 's missing , not normally listen to do n't move on , <unk> ?
so it 's right .
it 's so damn , so they have n't mean , the three characters are falling and i find me one .
it 's really care , yeah ?
it 's completely clear , because that the chances that they <unk> lucky , is yes <unk> just about one-third .
<unk> , there are three things , it 's really care , yeah ?
now i do this , i 'll just one on .
well , i know of course , where it 's .
<unk> that has anybody here , <unk> .
so i know where it 's say , and the rates and appreciate that , either way of taking calls it , go to a second round .
so i 'm actually now the rules to tell me now , basically now only <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , imagine i <unk> me on the a , <unk> ?
but anyway , i have a door to kind of it 's say , and you are not have said .
because if you are b to say , and i say , and i know , it 's not from b .
then you could n't second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , of luck .
but i have yes , it 's <unk> , in the second round go .

now is the question , and this is the <unk> probability , under the condition is what remained under which one condition that , b open , and it 's not there is , you 've now your last chance to news to guess .
they must now at a stick , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm going to do what they want .
or they say , i do c on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with that likely that 's gone ?
phew , very nice , b is on , so i know , it 's behind c .
right now , thank god , b opened up that has been , i wanted forever , at a stick , this is it .
or would you say , there 's <unk> , we have to <unk> away , so , we 've only two doors , it 's now whatever you to shift or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's not care .
<unk> .
why is no matter ?
very beautiful .
why is why is <unk> ?
yeah , right , it 's wrong .
this seems to know almost as if we do it yesterday that greeted that they 're <unk> ?
but this is them , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , so here , the thing is very <unk> , yes .
understand that all between , i do n't , six and , yes , i ca n't <unk> years , because i can i 'll do n't participate , <unk> ?
so , this issue that indeed anyone .
after this door is going to a third .
and it 's always just to a third plant behind a door .
you can guess what they want to do with two thirds are they 're shit .
so , they would be able to two doors to guess , do you can listen to look at <unk> do , you can listen to two dozen a seat , then it 's yes , <unk> , if you are zero time <unk> , it 's all in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , here 's so here , two-thirds from is n't know what you guess .
so is that two-thirds here , but it ca n't just behind a door lie !
behind the is n't !
so , what is likely ?
uh-uh , i did n't actually wrapped up .
so what 's likely ?
it 's to get to keep , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , naturally .
so that was n't exactly hardball . <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
so in luck .
why ?
very simple , including two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope it was for anybody what it .
so much .
mr. <unk> , i want to look like jamie oliver <unk> who 's just by bad food and bad food and overweight people says , this depressed a yes completely .
but i <unk> 'em my best way , that later everything away is that his impressions .
i 'll get 'em , because of <unk> farm and did until i 12 steps were actually not a mcdonald 's .
it 's just to approach , right .
, yes .
so much for inviting us today .
i 'm here in close up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> also has raised on that came to wonder whether i felt at ted curator at sea and others and wo n't about some common theme to talk about .
i gave me <unk> <unk> : this theme of trust .
now , motivation is not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> who has said , perhaps making the one or other after all sports .
about something i also full of this .
so tonight about the rain down to do jogging go to be now <unk> much needs , but i have this morning in fact that train , because i in three weeks on <unk> june , at <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to go want to <unk> bike -- that 's <unk> miles .
other words like to stay on the morning when rains this training do n't get freed up .
so if you ride , you want <unk> , go tomorrow early on , in <unk> , i <unk> ' they all welcoming this .
i got degrees ' said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> about this theme of trust .
and i got started , extra to the subject <unk> .
n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , blind faith comes after <unk> .
i got before me stop thinking about it made when i <unk> 'm like to describe my best position where i <unk> ?
so i come out <unk> village via six ] houses , many <unk> , some <unk> and for my parents were on farm there 's apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what you make <unk> , `` beer .
trust , in sports , obviously not in <unk> but for me , <unk> and beer .
why tell `` i get the story , where i come ?
for me is one of very important stories that i really so right away land , from village get 'em , and there was raised with two big brothers , with the oldest brother who <unk> is .
and with the second brother who just blind is like me .
means that looks very bright and dark , who can look like i just also see where <unk> window in space , whether it on lights or it 's like .
what today , very convenient is for the <unk> .
the , or we both can you see when faced with us anything is .

the subject for the old men , <unk> .
and so far <unk> .
and what to me , but keep it was critical of course it 's been the fact , suggesting you trust and receive a sort of this great confidence that <unk> that everyone needs to <unk> as something <unk> situation , say i got .
and that was for my parents definitely , you know how many of them , before my brother and i still not the blind people knew .
we were so the first , who will be quite spontaneously rises in their lives <unk> are .
and then did it from the situation seems to what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a huge fortunate that my parents were farmers are not all day time had lived alongside us to stand and look at hand to make or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you go along and can then <unk> feel where you <unk> .
a to be the awkward been -- we have to home so <unk> .
and b in ham , our parents of the beginning of us to have encouraged , always go to go wherever , of my unsighted brother is .
so , at home alone <unk> , the stairs <unk> and <unk> , it also a chance .
there is the blind brother me up with <unk> <unk> <unk> courtyard , pushed <unk> tags , in .
the very complex the very complex things i wanted to remember today .
so that 's with the big brothers -- they 're not only good for my elbow it 's in the <unk> .
and our brothers , and my brothers and i we ham in <unk> courtyard , just really that everything out doing what ma ' you can do , especially for example , biking .
and this is the <unk> brother of enthrallment started with three years and then we wanted and also -- michael and i .
and you have begun to <unk> to drive , as before , many little kids , today about running wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have this starting with <unk> , eventually leaving .
and then is the big question : how <unk> ma , there ?
and what gets you the trust , one , the trust a parent that the children and eventually brought back from our bikes to descend and <unk> and then the trust of us that we 're not permanently where contrast , drive .
and our solution was that we obviously a , from our parents tell us have braking , where are the <unk> , so where is a car , where <unk> tags , where are and maybe even need any <unk> things , sure enough homes -- that puts it 's no way -- there , we knew that they are .
and we had to us between orient to us that one can you know , but also hear .
and that you can now in here , unfortunately , not all of testing , because otherwise , interestingly , here as loud , she had nothing more of this .
but <unk> ' evening when it 's light up and look at their bedrooms , whose bedrooms , whatever it 's leaders want .
you can try to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and you 'll notice that is freedom of people just like bats as you will take a resistance to hear .
so much as bats are so with <unk> is so you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance because the sound happening anywhere else <unk> will .
and this is for me on trust , so trust in the movement , always very important point .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the security , i got <unk> chance to me there <unk> piece of helping .
and me a sort of grain without a big trouble and clear , even without many accidents , the one or another -- there 's obviously do .
what i unfortunately , now any images more got about that i 'm very <unk> is wonderful , from one of <unk> as children .
namely , from his climb on our higher state building on <unk> farm .
i got there was writing , the confidence also emerging from a <unk> diversity .

got about the never as you may have significantly to read .
so , but also informs to do with that it obviously not everybody as true of experiments can find great .

and our brother 's just that again , who did michael and i always its on top of the house .
so they 're going to say , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
there 's to anywhere from <unk> window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the morton then he <unk> , michael afterwards and i got about probably still <unk> bit like this girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but finally , who stays in thinking about the bottom ?
so i do n't .

and of so i 'm taken , but always with .
and then was taken the implication that we would all three <unk> <unk> up sitting has and dad with <unk> tags , with <unk> <unk> <unk> and do n't even more know what he now supposed to say ,
because trust is obviously going away , if any doubt .

is ' but never happens .
he did they will always get <unk> that he 's also `` then slowly <unk> , or by johannes <unk> , of us will be attributed to .
and that was `` i get to me very great that we those possibilities before .
but right , n't worry that 's not a principal , not necessary to go back <unk> to make .
for me were the differences in sports , the in my life whenever matter who were all , yes interesting .
and mostly they were all of <unk> , because i also `` could see , where got me so my limits what might have so my endowments .
so to <unk> good <unk> i 'd never be able to .
so i had never the <unk> .
and i go ' yet empowered , not like to <unk> .
i go ' yet empowered , rather out to rain .
now do n't believe in five degrees of the moment .
and at <unk> rainfall -- but rather than just inside his .
but i got time for me so this faith in my strengths with first discovered that i do different sports try got about .
it first example , <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful because there 's a trainer , of us in <unk> had , has said : ok , we have is louder <unk> children and send ' us <unk> few blind children .
it 's ok. good , because there are you might one another thing to poke them .
and it makes you know what the other people power .
and there was always get my big trust , obviously knew when i the competition to take place 'm going 's hard , because he ca the other perhaps sink out what do what i did n't <unk> in .
so there 's just a way , and this is the confidence in my speed .
the other 're putting a foot in the <unk> to make me ask yourself backwards and drop , the <unk> head to throw rocks and then it 's sitting behind and the competition is over , because it the full score is happening .
i 'll get it is not to yourself .
i 'd do i 've got but <unk> .
i <unk> ' , this is now <unk> bit risky .
and so i would also now here is not a volunteer , right ?
<unk> .
oops , i <unk> ' time .
okay .
the next to me point was an exercise in school , but then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or , until this <unk> and that they took us to be trained as kids .
but for me was always in school , wait a very important , how can i could write a lot also to school move to my excess energy getting rid ?
and i was then as a way in school <unk> to make .
and while i 'm always thought , this is how it ' <unk> boring , because <unk> is sort of the <unk> rather , <unk> `` i get .
finding 'em i once -- <unk> ' i 'm not anymore .
so i then eventually said : well , i do with the <unk> .
and got about screw it just begun , gee , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because you condition need , if you need power , <unk> good coordination , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have lots also of their work done ?
this is it also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you simply the full of confidence in your technology has .
so if you trust in your power has -- so the force that you are also `` then at any circumstances , the bad weather , at yield to snow , at <unk> snow has also to skiing can associate .
and if you in my case also `` trust in the team has .
because when <unk> who do n't see , i 'm also depend <unk> <unk> .
and i there 's never experience that <unk> happens like today -- i have to the word use -- my <unk> -- there 's outfitted with only -- has already even my exercise done .
does nothing , we do n't yet again .

do with a , one , one of them after another practice .
what i was always perform the subject <unk> trust , which is the exercise , that i did that audience can find ourselves 'm like this is , if you do n't see just <unk> to make up with their 40s <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> yes is : you have two sticks in the hand .
of it 's why : yeah , got about 'm not in their hands more free , because i could do my ' <unk> take and became the <unk> <unk> .
's not .
so i must be different helping .
and i picked up my <unk> of the ago , i 'm running .
and the tell me to the vote the way .
so the needs to follow constantly wanting precise <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precise with communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> 's who tells me <unk> and <unk> of who would say , left at 11 , then i know it 's easy to the left , so at the upper part of <unk> o'clock at the pointer .
if he says , the left , tens of little sharper left , and when he says , right to 10 .
okay , all the robot ?
then <unk> <unk> problem because then i have to make another responds or they want to me back to correct , then i know , anyway , here 's is what does n't .
and for me that 's the big , critical , when the <unk> ago , i 'm running , then i have the really completely <unk> to go on a negative to say .
so he 's positive to say , he 's me the tools that it would take place , you really then quickly to be and in <unk> even faster than others that the same competition to launch .
and that i can only when i get it 's just manage , with both arms up <unk> to me <unk> , on a leg up and i have to actually now the eyes to do -- ha ha , or she could also open , and that leads to know anything .
and have to screw it so <unk> and must then on the other one leg and just over here and must be here <unk> bit going to even , but does actually as well give up .
well , high shoes .
yes , and this is me the very important , when i <unk> 'm just goes : how <unk> i get it , the type of saying , so i tell guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had , what i manage it 's just to say , bless you got me the right <unk> do , because of course , who does mean myself .
the white , so , not what he tell me to .
so i [ that are placed the way to communicate it 's just open to .
and that 's like in each of the process .
if you knew my needs n't know , it can see me , obviously do n't help , but there is me just asked and must say , well , i need feed from you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> earlier <unk> .
and i need ' of you like now when i 'm cycling , you for me also `` time he says , how long as the mountain , and there 's because if we the <unk> <unk> , because you think , yes some distant time : now , it has yet been over .
and goes back in like nuts and the object seems to be on .
and there needs ' point , i 've also grow up the pilot how it by cycling , is , on <unk> <unk> front of me and says we have unfortunately only 20 minutes backstage of us , because we may -- so we ham recent times <unk> minutes to come -- there are n't wait until another rather <unk> .

i listen , ' <unk> -- there 's sake of others , the most <unk> <unk> driving ?
who provides more ?
so my best was time ever run faster , but that was in september and now so in april , may i 's actually never as much faster could recall how thirty-six minute .
and the <unk> now , very <unk> .
and for me , but again , these are actually the <unk> will only possible if i just my ear open got about .
the other just showed me also explained to what it to see me and so the possibility of what 's my risk perfectly to estimate .
and this is for me is the very important thing why i say , trust is more training and not this banana <unk> .
so carry them as a blind and now is not much , frankly -- from <unk> .
because i also been the experience was that she had a <unk> right , and left off <unk> had .
and then it was in the competition used to be bad , because it up against the route three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- well , that 's back -- of course <unk> misdirected .
i know that , because the <unk> has to listen to turn to have so <unk> <unk> .
and me , it happens now permanently , i was people say , the left and say then , <unk> , the other side .
so i was then put all right , unfortunately .
power in life often is not much like .
but right , in <unk> situation with pressure , that they will probably also all of the work or school , anyway that if it 's rapidly go through .
it 's obviously , precision , often , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , but again , is <unk> trust a sort of all that i the risks they 've got .
and i mean , i can tell you to tell me as someone who does n't see , relative size of the advantage because i <unk> 'em my risk in ways .
so when <unk> <unk> ' i 'm going to basically all .
the driving <unk> tree , from falling slope from down <unk> that i know , and i <unk> ' well , naturally -- and this is so the point -- i <unk> ' even the good news sites .
the fact , you get to be able to think that trust you know , there is .
and when somebody has found that 's really a hundred percent of so <unk> , i do n't hiring architects need .
and to and i mostly also the goals got about .
because this is for me in the subject , trust is simply the next , very important .
you need the same purpose and let me just really want to realize what is that be really , trust to go ?
because of this is often <unk> quickly realized that you 've used .
i trust the or the right myself .
but the real key is yes , that 's too much depend on .
that you can make sure that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you do it 's -- because we do anything with <unk> <unk> purpose meeting -- we want <unk> sense that there .
and the point , which is quite often that we also `` well , 'n end up to do .
that we do it -- in my case for example , from some tears , weeks got about i am i went on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i am : so let me now somebody , by looking at or the i saw in the case that trust is that i just this mountain , above that i get .
and how you make of it is looking at the mountain , eventually , really up here ?
well now , i was obviously the huge advantage , i got some things going to do n't catch , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively <unk> .
ca <unk> advantage to be , it 's heights actually have no problem .
and i got about whatever it back of heights to work , here independently of the <unk> i 'm now and let 's got about i 'll have done <unk> <unk> nor am in berlin <unk> flew , there 's being exposed to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's some <unk> bit <unk> , if you 're going up there 's and below the cars , listening then you must do n't even more see , and so to know now , do it hurts when i <unk> .
and these things are for me more interesting point .
suffice to be the <unk> to have to simply too to know , `` hey , i war on the way , i was so yes , focus , <unk> and can go through trial and <unk> new new experience have .
now that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes is : you go every day , 10 hours to go down and it 's okay , just for boring
you go and leaves , has only do rocks to itself around , and fewer plants .
you take on <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun while ago <unk> first <unk> we have .
so if you <unk> hybrid see it , is the <unk> about the last , of the <unk> .
of about it so the only the exciting .
we have the hybrid just using which seen or the other thing .
of so <unk> `` i get there <unk> great confidence in the <unk> -- despite its strange <unk> that he did that had .
because i thought got about : well , so , as was there <unk> ' i probably the speed way , like to of the thing charging out .
but as i said , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you wait to <unk> actually now not really great transformation did .
and really exciting , interestingly , then , if so something hard to happen .
so if you go upward into <unk> and the air to be thinner , is .
or if it next to a very well , if you <unk> little <unk> , where 's left , right well .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if it also in the night , and all of a headlight <unk> , we had the <unk> even sometimes said : now he would i prefer to string take , so he then i 'm also really in a look and the handle it .
because i was only without a headlight , there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we put it created that i just said was : well , i can describe my with , my friend who here was a hundred percent of confidence , i <unk> ' you and we have this little good <unk> .
but i need ' either <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus has , because what you can imagine if you go on the mountain climb says <unk> stone , right , right on one , left at 11 .
there will eventually you <unk> that , for all .
so , for our faith in the case that point , we 're looking <unk> connection , so ham 's a string hanging in your backpack attached that i had in the hand and grew up behind her in which loosely <unk> wire running .
had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> bit of the height of stairs i noticed got about .
and it 's then eventually , just stuck with the foot <unk> stone kicked or has a brick <unk> <unk> stone <unk> that i also `` already know what do n't want to advancing and i 'm not permanently just focus had .
and what do the whole thing really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , you sort of course , i realized then eventually , because the top , approaching you just showed that goal really that back in the corner does -- just like we also in <unk> , with the <unk> .
but it 's also like that i noticed got about that trust that i wanted to me got about that is ' <unk> just because when i actually now <unk> goal got about how to follow the top .
but the trust is in other there , the <unk> , like trust just work .
then when we night and follow the mountain <unk> are , we were in the class often very ahead and behind us are the other seven people to mit and they were always be reasonably close behind us and it does everyone to break was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why stop the because why look because wherever anybody that he showed up behind us to walk ?
nighttime , you can keep the girls not by adding a look .
this is n't quite the reason , apparently .
and then got about i eventually they noted , hah , ok , right , their faith in their skills he 's degree also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night in the darkness , it 's about 12 watch out , then starting from any light .
this is really tiring to get <unk> is , the air to be thin , so actually just hard -- and not anymore <unk> first place .
and then but eventually , so the moment where the wait , have said yes , man , that was actually really practical , behind you to go , because your friend of mine has just showed me all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like the women stop doing .
have all night at doing something that tells and the others in the group were right there are also `` so the approval , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , which has to you 'll tell me .
and i did you what else entirely what do n't have the mountain tell me .
and this to know , it 's another person there , which had been maybe just bad go <unk> about maybe we have time talking about -- it 's only <unk> hour , the sun comes to depart on .
these things that even mirrors from outside can trust , again significantly increase and can just to contribute that you like the personal <unk> just done .
and for me that trust is mainly , then given and is largely get perfect , if you do so the personal <unk> and what you really want , then eventually it 's also in the idea of the right there is .
this is natural course , in the sports on the gold , in this is how you <unk> -- i 'm not , why the athletes do -- potentially , i do n't want to the value to test scores or to look at whether it 's just lead <unk> is ?
so i <unk> ' for some medals it 's so , in vancouver , who were <unk> gram of hard .
if it all real gold would , <unk> i 'm not here , then i would look at the bahamas , <unk> i .
or lots , lichtenstein , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i <unk> ' the real , why you do this is more that you can imagine : what got about i really have degrees created and as i asked my skills and forces focused on a point .
and they 've got me to me in my talent , but obviously the team that everyone needs , however , whether in education , the job in which one thing no matter .
anyway , whether old man , or young woman , we need to find people , including in the we trust them .
and if we then that goal in their head clear before have eyes and it also have achieved , it 's the best evidence that we at least in a project in our lives trust could .
and if you go up to be able to do you left at certainly in other areas .
so much
a science for me , this is the title my talk , who actually formed in <unk> its beautiful cards .
what i tick , is the whole <unk> effort ; the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
basically i could be satisfied be .
i go back into barnes <unk> , there 's all <unk> with just reading to science of the issues that <unk> <unk> is .
even any <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , magazines , where science , addressing <unk> issues , quite understandable , are portrayed it .
every station has least a <unk> where some scientific issues are eating up .
even imagine that 's totally <unk> , if you look what it in magazines and magazines for children are all the science stuff .
every program has somehow got ta keep my own branch in <unk> , but still is that a pure <unk> story .
science is a thing that they can i want to see that i want to read , but that it accounts for me n't even .
cool , is cool science just kind of on csi to search for breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist to cool , <unk> ?
on csi such a <unk> five minutes , has anything with the reality to do , but it 's cool , <unk> ?
there , because i do identify .
big bang reliably , because i can feel about laughter , i understand the jokes , but it 's fine .
this is incredibly unfortunate .
because that 's kind of a little counterintuitive , the future we 'll just manage to be able to the things , technological issues and stuff .
but at any harbor ecosystem that none of itself off .
i have some small to give you 've collected , like science versus science starting with us as a special significance in .
a very <unk> example , in london , you take a nice little tower , built , <unk> , the architect , and let 's not so now , we build the time somehow , so this curved .
what happened , right now that the sunlight from above in the glass facade of falls , i want to be provisional error , is different targets and then go somewhere in other waterfront in some point <unk> .
you could capitalize on the press , it had unfortunately starting in the jaguar .
sad , the heat , that channeled , that this poor <unk> which is really long , long it saved enough , there are the <unk> able to .
because you wonder , such an architect , it 's not really kind of times as a little thing in physics learned , because i mean , is completely new , that such a mirror of thing is focused .
so what i found , a new one is <unk> , somehow <unk> before christ , where he said that with streams a fleet sink out .
because i ask myself in fact , what 's the more design or architecture or where he studied ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , which one significance as such actual things have it 's also the genetic engineering .
genetic engineering , that 's already a few years ago when it just kind of the media got .
there was the train a bit freaky , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at once a danger .
genes , believing in green engineering .
genes been somehow what its own .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there was situations where on the market farmers are really gotten to have , `` hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yes .
so , yeah , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can think about discussing .
but to the time i was in the lab and more active bonded and was eventually , totally frustrated because i 've tried to those evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was completely frustrated , came home , and my then-director neighbor , `` oh , you see it 's not happy , what 's the world ?
i was this : yeah , i try there for three days as a little gene in my bacterial cells to transform and that does n't actually .
so what i tried to explain to , so somehow a <unk> , genetics , i thought , yes , does the nice lady , if i think about genes 'm going to know , you see what you think it .
so what i actually goes , so a particular sequence that i there in this <unk> <unk> bring wanted .
but that was what the female molecule has .
this woman has i 'll never the hand shook up .
who knows what i you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's own .
this is already well as 10 years ago , and still has this kind of the minds basis .
genes that 's also what its own .
<unk> i 'd rather long n't read .
it 's would be in gene and technology essentially free and it 's really show in our language draw illusion .
<unk> want to europe , was a headline .
<unk> is different a lot of altered corn that yes does n't need genes that contains .
and a headline to <unk> those rats used to die .
yes , it was also a beautiful headline .

anyway , whether the time or the picture , all of <unk> .
fortunately it 's not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid that wo n't have more time .
but that simply shows that uncertainty in the population now , because they just does n't want to get things on afterwards .

now was just <unk> , nobody had the big on the topic , but there are about things voting and taught what the most really no idea here .
and it 's pretty sad .
how does n't actually this information from the lab in the population ?
if we think that little boy , motivated scientists are sitting in his lab , has an experiment that we explore something , fair enough , and he drops think , gee , it 's kind of times what that interested in the public .
it must be the first place in the professor go .
the head , who you decide , okay , cool topic that puts his name on the first author , that 's always important in science , first invitation .
good idea , i 'm still not in public , it goes to a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , class , because we do a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we have a <unk> on a project , a nice idea , and this is then some point out that went ivory tower .
this is then <unk> , yeah , but to whom it ?
now are those institute rarely go by , usually have multiple <unk> such a shared a substrate , a common <unk> .
and all of these are then the <unk> that really cool projects that are then over the <unk> at the magazines that bent on the <unk> , whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
of the ground it will continue filtered out in ivory up until the fact , really cool experiments , who really <unk> projects , there in those magazines of those properties .
these are very high-quality magazine that are really well done , there 's of all , there 's free , yes , but who get i mean ?
basically just the at the most of interest .
in the <unk> we call it always the <unk> the <unk> .
so those who might have to be interested , the <unk> then the newspaper , yes , fair enough .
beautiful magazine , reached the audience , which at the most of interest , and it , maybe about a hunch , where <unk> 's about it in these items .
who <unk> ' i mean really ?
the <unk> that it might interest .
the uh-uh , that was now , the otto citizen that i call the time , mr. <unk> <unk> , the circumstances other publications we 're reading , i tried , it neutral , to keep the that i get it was n't really .
anyway , again , our future we 'll just seems to rise can , if we use that <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , they 're all issues that <unk> are that mr. <unk> not really understand , and about it seems to vote would .

because what usually happens that a scientist so i have a buddy , we know us for almost 20 years , he 's <unk> , it of speech is a <unk> rule , did n't want to his job to ask .

<unk> that are scientists who tell you 've been a kind of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds reactivity , <unk> , chemically 's almost like that same level of genes .
chemically treated , this is somehow , oh , you do n't know what it 's .
the really teach , hey up , that 's fair enough , if you on a conference are and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want to you can really love of <unk> tell , but of bleeding again , you say , but basically just some water .
what 's the problem . it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school so , which is my idea of these young scientist who are still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> that are just a little malleable to the school i how to bury argued .
so it for everyone to profit , <unk> , however , investors who want to know what 's in the <unk> happens .
eventually they meet the tax money that there are used , so they must be really well , of <unk> communicate .
but these training , that 's just a story .

there 's a quote , i do n't know if this is real , of albert einstein , if you 's not just tell you can , then you do n't really understood .
so , the scientists at the lab to take and giving project really need to rethink about how should i really quite normal intelligible to communicate ?
so stories , there 's already several .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in the ability to university , custom , but there also get i basically just over the <unk> .
who drive since the <unk> end of the city in the university at some tapering off , puts out a talk to <unk> <unk> down ?
this is that that it might interest .
so i was my <unk> .
so that are people who might be able to be interested in that there and drive out of these talks sound .
that 's nice , there are any <unk> done , all are satisfied , all are happy to drive home and it was left .
so he placed i still on a second aspect to say , there is not about this <unk> the project .
this scientist will have a trained as ticking actually children ?
because many really have forgotten , on the key to decrease .
because scientists how the research , and how children living in the world and explore , is the same .
kids to work quite amazing sense of the science .
they do something like learn the flight .
they try something , it work ?
<unk> , falling down -- uh-uh , not working , next iteration , i change a couple of parameters , i do it 'll soon .
children learn an extremely scientifically .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> what happens , which factors i needed to change that it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have many forgotten .
and of so i think , really can work that only if then the <unk> comes and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood in the environment with the children were kind of kindergarten , from the elementary school , there together make some experiments of children , on their <unk> , and there on really respond to engage with , because i am convinced that the children and the scientists really basically the same language to talk .
and then you can perhaps , maybe someday , this is so my hope to tell the children the fact , at home , and then i get me as mr. <unk> who will also in one for scientific topics are interested , because the kids to him that tell you .
that there 's not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not something like , galileo , but his children to tell him to do that it <unk> mirror to a <unk> was working that it 's a bread <unk> that we have paper <unk> , and understand , and shaking , maybe even the head , as an architecture would build a house can .
and not only get me and of course , mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it just remember that the first <unk> that i call , i have said , yes -- uh-uh , so , <unk> for our scientist , that this is just not subject , they are other priorities .
a scientist has n't do it can communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , and i call me the next to .
but who somehow in a department to work , <unk> is in a company , however , there are going to the next moment .
so much .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
fly you can not every day .
the last weeks were terrible .
the weather set us a massive stroke of the bill did .
in seven , after eight years , i 've been asked if i got here 's take you .
i was first ceo , almost 10 years , the <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're pretty much up to be .
had <unk> as a client .
and for me it was really well , it 's kind <unk> .
what do it ?
<unk> , that 's pretty ridiculous .
i then we 've learned how that is and so i stand here today .
and well maybe it 's a little nuts , but it 's certainly , too high emotionally .
it 's nice and more exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'll just in the next <unk> , hit eighteen minutes a bit of that 's life <unk> tell you .
i 'm american ceos in <unk> .
the company , there for hundreds and <unk> years .
i 'm ceo of <unk> .
this company has since 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company has been estimated <unk> or eighteen years .
the managing the zeppelin based on here at <unk> .
zeppelin .
the one image that i 'm here have to show , the little thing right , that 's actually as a red , such a <unk> it , or anything to do n't know that same thing is just too big .
there are going to the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and it 's actually just along the last 10 to take action .
so this is already what .
there 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so this is actually not like a market .
this is not just a niche drugs .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why you do it really ?
how do this place ?
<unk> in numbers and only 10 to take action , we can do afterwards , go talk about why this is .
a comment on the story .
<unk> has a lot of crazy <unk> <unk> the air transport here created .
very short quick .
has to <unk> fourteen before the first <unk> about eighteen <unk> into it launched .
then got the first <unk> , <unk> zeppelin was dying by <unk> and <unk> , were about <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
and they 've got to london bombed , so on and so forth .
and when we <unk> and eight to london came up , and with a large <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , were the english newspapers <unk> full of the headline . this time they come , but not to bombs , but in peaceful intent .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had a dupe of this campaign .
but <unk> , the consumer , was n't quite pleased to because it suddenly realize that 's become what this thing that would put that old memory is inside , put all .
and you know that was taken for marketers have a bit critical .
but it was in london a good work out of the weather in north end up there was many years ago pretty bad and very windy .
and we 're not very much went .
then a <unk> two decades , <unk> 21 hugo <unk> have adopted that .
so , and a <unk> seeing that we 're going to america are delivered it .
this has a myth <unk> that all the german nation , sort of will build something felt , when you <unk> and <unk> the airship kidnapped again .
there was the wind up in in new york welcomed with <unk> .
and all the german nation 's out of has <unk> , we 're going out who .
this is in all <unk> so inside and this is something that tells a little at all myths collide with this device .
but actually are going to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven zeppelins even if you can actually built and actually just two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg was , the passengers promoted this .
passengers a hundred , where about <unk> passengers and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> then used to the first live filmed crash with me as well unfortunately , yes <unk> .

and the other machines got tuned .
and <unk> , <unk> the last still exists zeppelins destroyed .
the the materials are used for <unk> , <unk> to reverberate pull out .
it was able to take nothing about <unk> years .
and then they had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin based on the had the idea , maybe you should it back to start .
and i was discontinued <unk> because there 's technically a brilliant product has evolved to come we 're going to , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what is there really matter ?
so .
talk about we now .

there are many companies that , for that corporation be made .
there are today <unk> staff , about 20 billion more revenue .

there 's a lot behind .
they get me then also believe , up here to come .
the zeppelin about it 's actually a normal plane as each other infinite plane , but let me , sorry , has <unk> a gas , helium are not evolve hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale , of the water on and right shows , and since the <unk> to make .
the time now is n't there , the details of them to explain .
inside does a zeppelin look like a structure .
there are two varieties of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , this is us , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
they get inside , no structure and they 're sort of balloon ended up in <unk> .

and it 's only today , as i said before , only <unk> in which consisted of minus our actual numbers , so about it only two decades .
so then the production from when an envelope grew into .
the left the structure that again .
and the shell is too high technology .
comes from <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the roots .
we spend one point two million dollars as a shell .
and it 's got <unk> to be able to <unk> be and must also <unk> be , because every time you must mean looking at that if you have a crack in it would be a hole that it 's not tear it .
do the <unk> again <unk> and you look closely , whether it 's going on holes in control .
and the end looks a flying airship on without that grow look like it 's there .
the zeppelin was so technically a <unk> product
and that you see here the numbers , very short time .

this is very very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
they can see real time .
but there 's another trend which gives us in the moment of anxiety does and the have i grew up here mapped .
we had three years before forty-three percent <unk> when i started to have a half ago <unk> five , about eight years , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may we were at <unk> percent .
if you the eight years , my eight years , the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> derive , you want you can say at least in these eight years of course , a <unk> the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years has the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can be kind of passengers neither of fog fly .
they want to know something you see .
and the <unk> or <unk> going up nearly every year steadily for .
so a little imagination of that our weather is not just felt , but as well statistically , because we do shine a day , to change .
but because that 's so , which is now the right , has the e.u . a program the hook <unk> , to do almost 10 million dollars and we 're an integral part of that program .
i come morning 's coming from finland .
this airship that is equipped us is a my lab today .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between ground and <unk> meters .
which means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t 's flying in italy , to come up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many hundreds <unk> measuring the and analyze the air out how the chemical reactivity , as you 're reacting to our things that we the ground do .
there , i 've just told you up there we 're doing with the second airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and is , if you want concrete <unk> from the theme of weather .
it 's so very good .
and here are able to get a few <unk> .
this airship on with sweden last week or <unk> week .
and to finland is by the weather 's good , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the finns say something like they had never .
i 've got there are wonderful , beautiful warm days , in 1953 .
these mosquitos used then also not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to de <unk> as <unk> diamond seek out , better way volcanoes seek out that <unk> that are worn away from this is through erosion of three million years .
but you can also be asking , is that 's all over africa , is that then a self-driving rather than if you do to make sense to ask for an idea worth , to make sense of question is useful if you also in theatres , at the film <unk> or <unk> diamond 's running is .
because i 've ever wondered , so what do there really ?
and whatever leverage this really ?
the end we were looking for two years , then also done .
the ode then he does n't have on .
the whole <unk> came back <unk> and the project was then finish .
and a tornado , the zeppelin based the mast is go back to sort of damage that he also going down remain .
was not so bad .
we had this very good insurance cards and were actually pretty happy .
this is the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do .
yeah , what we doing today , a very quick <unk> out of the phoenix <unk> .
what we doing today , this is happening around , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or lived .
what we doing today is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do maintenance of course .
we we need to the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are n't always been tracking device inside , after 10 , 15 yet again , to be replaced these issues .
we replace just the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the client <unk> about it back yet .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're an airline <unk> operations , by the germans <unk> and of the european supervision in control , is always in recordings , to review of <unk> , or so but airbus .
this is also <unk> and costs money and just keep going to get up .
the question is , does it on ?
you want to continue going ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there are <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what makes you really ?
you go on in the market ?
you go further into practice ?
and so we obviously in my time ever attempted .
and we have some <unk> sustained them .
what actually also the <unk> zeppelin some <unk> has sustained and many times bust out .
so initially at the <unk> stood still a donation of <unk> .
the population of the german population has it was rescued by six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship <unk> were and he basically we broke up , she has the population of him a donation done .
and it 's even the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies built , because we 're sitting right <unk> today i might not here and other companies would be seen .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco to a customer .
it would put a very <unk> investor .
two projects are unfortunately failed .
so even <unk> .
once we have <unk> won .
so i no image on , because we do <unk> <unk> n't show you can .
but now in america is now the <unk> of the first <unk> in the get done .
we have three piece of the street .
with <unk> we build as a moment with partners , also technically is new .
and this is a huge success , but also have to the loss of thing .
two customers are basically to liquidate the '50s , because it 's not left .
why did n't it ?
we know it already be .
either it was the site not the right or the passengers had too far <unk> or in america 's familiar to know you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham , people have <unk> , have the airship on , historically have said , `` oh , another , again , a <unk> , the power plug .
there 's the did n't that you <unk> can .
and it was basically double the difficulty in marketing is over to finish : hey , people call it , and it flies .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to moderate a year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we just <unk> done , because of weather .
there 's missing then they 're going to a half million .
that there 's bad .
the zeppelin flies <unk> routes here .
it 's the point of course it 's beautiful , if i also when ceos and see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we basically are n't do ads , because it . speak to my mouth gets over and we about <unk> sold coupon have and people say , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , known and who can also , on in the family .
and we are great booking .
whereas i kept clean need to the mistake that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still more flights to do .
we have such a <unk> at <unk> and we were <unk> .
it is actually not quite .
we do with advertising .
that 's time the <unk> been that audi <unk> has .
and audi 's done this is to do with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult market .
and we have to sometimes the <unk> imagine : do pitches up meaning ?
we 've had nearly enough ads , but the internet has many changes that <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> is why are today just another 10 , active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .

so there are then six of 10 .
so we 're then the market in fact , if it does one is to control .
and hope , and try and again a future we expect to do .
and what finally , david , scott , commander of apollo 15 , after he <unk> paris <unk> and five , he said <unk> the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's nice .
do ads , we find of nice .
but we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
we have to customers .
this is not a gradual .
it 's <unk> , goes up and down .
one such as a <unk> takes years until you get .
and then there , again , years , no .
there 's too funny effect that easy for and hard to control are .
certainly is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the world , so actually no market .
yet we do on .
it 's an icon on the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
you imagine just able to the question : what kind of shape we make it on ?
how much money , we give in the world ?
what do what do for here ?
what kind of shape is this is going anywhere ?


and then there was a <unk> about greenpeace , in the money , choked and are n't know what they do with them -- and almost at it 's actually have disappeared .
there you me employee , to the way to retool prisons .
and i have three years , greenpeace meeting as <unk> and now i do it here in hopes , a long road in the zeppelin to do .
zero , are they ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , very much .
this is my three things that i in the eighteen minutes to discuss today .
why we are today in excess , or were abundant ?
how we get into a soulfulness .
and especially , what do ?
what 's what is it 's really ?
we start with our initial point .
the first part is perhaps slightly depressing .
but it 's drum , the challenges to show .
by a few years about ' that even harder to admit that sort of explain .
that we have a problem today , you know every child .
we are environmental problems have .
but it 's worth of it comes over time i suggest that are the challenges that population [ for example .
all kinds <unk> is exponential increase .
if you think about it in a historical long term to see the <unk> for example , then it 's a very short , episode in history have been .
now , where we ca n't imagine that it seems like that 's when that <unk> again from avalanching over time .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some say , well , once they lost time , migrating , we look at the last <unk> years of .
you can also <unk> look , <unk> ' i also true .
you can say , who needs because glacier ?
you can say , the ocean is far away .
but it 's going on , if you get a little deeper look busy to sort of real challenge to things that actually going to avoid being true , otherwise we 've just difficulties in <unk> , the health .
<unk> it says there days over 30 degrees .
and there are 800 degrees ' of our cities like in vienna , or <unk> sort of getting increasingly more as bad .
it 's but also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas , where the big streams <unk> and the <unk> of which depend that there 's constantly water from the himalayas .
it 's finally , not about the planet .
the planet is the <unk> what we do , there was pretty much larger environmental crisis .
and churning way , but it 's about us to the people who sort of in a changing the decline very awkward will live .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts spreading out .
the water will still less .
this is the <unk> where an integral part of cotton heritage .
and it all , where that come from ?
all these bad things , say `` i time , depend in one or another form with the global resources together .
with what we collectively , from the planet get what we harvest .
not just going to the oil and these metals out and mineral , but those renewables commodities are kind of renewable , but after all over .
and we should just looking for us as low as possible of waste to as averages , less food waste and emissions to produce .
so it 's about this is in the introduction said they were all the resources really dramatically reduce their .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just c o 's two , <unk> by a car for a different but actually contrary to live .
contrary to economies .
our technology essentially entirely new to change .
if we 'll just <unk> the hunters and gatherers , and there are still on earth societies that basically like life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year out .
in a <unk> were it into the longest time of human history , three- to tons .
today , it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> has sort of resources .
and he 's very , unequally distributed in the earth .
it 's in north africa even more than with us with us more than in the earth 's portable , is .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , very much less .

and the other parts of the world faiths at the but increasingly less like .
and therefore we 're also the conflict that we find out of <unk> , is afghanistan , wherever you look . look at the maps of american <unk> survey and then you see where the resources from .
and this is there is there are very colorful , which is , there are many resources where the <unk> the world are .
so if we do with clean want , then we need to the subject on afterwards .
so we have to change the ecological limits that are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and what we start with this <unk> have life that that 's not <unk> .
this has been produced by mahatma gandhi stood up as he said , the world has enough to be performed needs , but not to performed greed .
and there we , like us here on average life for a lot about it .
so .
it was the sort <unk> part .
but i think holds that you need to understand it worth it also what to change .
even if i later going to say , it worth it also like to be opposed to live , which was more a soulfulness .
but it 's over again , as it out of <unk> <unk> you need to be a rationale , say `` i got .
so what 's actually a soulfulness .
and since we have to find that we 're going to own relative to share the world as much 've reached the economically , astounding amount of quality of the standard of yet we focus on average often not comfortable .
here 's a pretty bad mood , but there are people , and you know enough to people who are not so good can deal with this story .
i did n't written down .
<unk> and climate change have the same cause .
we work too much and too hard .
this is on the one hand we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy .
and on the other cause we just these resources .
but what 's a good life ?
how we can be defined ?
here 's sort of a little scientific break .
so is what i 'd say , and what i later tell me is scientific like , you grounded in , but this is it 's just drum , how should i sort first of defined ?
and there 's important to understand better quality was always two aspects .
quality of the aspect of objective terms as it made it 's what i 'm going to eat this .
i just a roof over the head ?
i just made friends ?
i always relate , i can stay alive to participate ?
but also `` , how 's me out how do n't go `` i get yourself in order to ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes for perceived quality .
and then <unk> `` i get two concepts to bring that look at the point is critical .
this one is responsive .
the needs are quite fundamental level of human flourishing , we knew that there is it ai to feelings .
if we need satisfy us to then we 're happy .
and needs one ca n't say , needs are sustainable , or not sustainable .
need per se 're not going to the resources .
what 's needs ?
you can tell various researchers to quote , i 've got only two called .
and there 's obviously the physical needs , but also need for safety , for social relations .
seeking protection , for participation , after <unk> , for creativity , to spirituality , for freedom .
it has a little thing with money to do .
but to a lot of you do n't actually , but the question is how can i do in my life at .
and there i am at the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy that i 'm going to me to 's technology to me that needs to deliver .
and there are going to be an ai that i can sort of a sea resources or arguing with less resources do .
because i can make money to hire or a little money need .
strategies that are sort of my behavior as i my needs <unk> .
so it with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i have .
if i little money to have to wind ' i changed my needs to try to satisfying as if i sort of money on account to this .
it 's start to the <unk> , which is the roof over the head , to eat , and then sort of the <unk> .
and this is it ai that can with loads or not enough resources that can sort of sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we all of strategies that gave me and available to my needs to fix , <unk> then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
it was the sort of scientific break .
and now is it ai what we can do now ?
how 's how do this ?
and there just some clues .
obviously has to this sort of everyone for himself to .
but the evidence for the individual 's kind of a technical sense , here is , <unk> ' i , much as i think about technology , talking about the '50s and finally able to a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , beginning to have sort said , the danger is that we speak at more affluence and more resources to consume .
after all the quality goes back to go down because the effects of getting worse , to speak , and there are averages , back to beat up .
or if we do it , as it 's in a different direction going to get less resources , maybe even at less consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
because there 's a my <unk> , may have heard him some of <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so much better quality at less resources .
there are much about technology like i could have any one thing here we use the computer , the craved for the coffee the car , the traffic , how can i like this unit ?
cement , so today is n't produce , i think that 's house of wood to build , etc. etc .
in order to significantly less resources , roughly the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this so simple , the <unk> per <unk> , and there we do with what today , i thought already discussed that has been , there 's kind gone up with about companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what services , i can actually fix this ?
and how should i looked at least not enough resources do ?
and it does n't deal with a little less but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there are many examples that this sort of them .
in vienna is a tower be built with 20 <unk> .
with seven <unk> it 's in <unk> already built .
so essentially from wood has .
that you , if you probably it in fifty years longer need to deconstruct it and then again in its parts and not speak to speak very much less resources which is consumed with all together and you get there is kind of the moment with half of and the goal is a fifth of <unk> , all over the age of the house designed with this one-fifth of <unk> long enough .
it 's also lots of our own , sort of how <unk> ' i really ?
sebastian <unk> has a wonderful book , <unk> .
where he shows how hard it finally , is sort of the from the sort of the treadmill out .
the <unk> , i want to myself takeoff ) the others come today , and then i 'm sort forever in this in this jog now this thing .
you itself has sort of entitlement , the back in the very satisfied , and then find `` i get the new .
and my favorite <unk> `` i get the <unk> that you 've all .
when i my department founded was a few years we still have letter writing .
then you like , you 'll be able to the letter return to write `` i <unk> email , is <unk> hell <unk> .
to write `` i get hundreds of emails .
and i can be very much further .
this is productivity , that 's gdp growth , we get a minute .
but i did n't really time it saved .
i 'm concerned about failure done .
there are but good examples , slow food for instance where i really sort of the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> to the foreground is paramount .
and with a little resources higher quality manage .
one of my <unk> is <unk> .

you can start to count .
number two years ago , three generations of tens of things that had had servants , personnel .
they get us who managed dissent .
we need to myself to deal .
and fewer people come out of course , with these all options .
and we need a guides , which helps us who help us <unk> with these few things things .
about ' <unk> `` i get interesting , maybe is also <unk> application of spacecraft 's going to <unk> `` i get to do n't find tens of things like .
the next example is use instead , own .
a real boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> has to speak about 20 years to somehow encoded in alternative was rotating been created .
meanwhile , use it became more people , if you look at <unk> thinking .
if you look at <unk> thinking .

what 's even invested was just being more efficient .
this is finally , also a question of justice .
i gave you were previously reported as they are unequally that 's take that an image between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
sort of so that all the same with these resources behaving this is just going to be possible if we really use less .
and that does n't hiring them less quality , because many of us <unk> been sort of a lot about .
but it 's a key challenge of economics , the company , these products , those services , actually provide the that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last thing , and it has something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> `` i get the time .
if you a bit toward the projections to read , it 's degree away from the oecd , <unk> , now this <unk> every week are these projections are back down <unk> .
it 's said , yes a crisis that 's in the door to my view , and after what we speak very much of economists 've talked and busy , there are the numbers of austria , you find that virtually all countries to push him go down .
and there are no reason to grow up to have , as what i did of my young , from the 1960 years , you know .
part is pure mathematics of reasons .
one point five percent growth is today is something like eight percent growth before fifty years .
and that eight percent is what china right now has .
they 're also about where we about fifty years were .
there , if the pie bigger -- is obviously very much time after eight percent <unk> .
the one percent is still much , so we 're good living .
but we have to speak on the design , which means that 's not even if we zero percent growth would , would it 's right next year precisely such manufacturing unit and consume and incomes , like this year .
we can really investing and so we could work .
that 's why not so wrong because you have these statistics knows that indicate that growth was hanging out for `` no longer with the quality together .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in developed countries around which said , which we are .
and actually also jobs are even without growth is possible , it 's not so inextricably jumbled up , like the us again and <unk> and you all the hot suggested to happen .
it is just not and then we need to also grow up with the economy built on afterwards .
and it comes over again and more frequently , that 's <unk> as scale or next week , <unk> ' i compare to come in the trend , a larger story with the subject to start to unthread that .
already <unk> have edward armour , the then-director nobel in his <unk> so <unk> that he said , the good life the good business , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
why are averages , and not about not primarily for those returns to create , not primarily about growth to create something for our countries do n't even more about .
in peru , and those countries , and in china , for india there 's the <unk> very different story .
and that will only then start to be under <unk> , if we tend to speak to grow and we just sort of this level , on this high levels of paper that we 're good going to live and economies .
to have left at the policy .
it takes some targets .
it takes some indicators we go , the economists .
it takes not just sort of the growth , but we should actually look , and measure and say , what about actually with the quality of the extracellular amount of ?
is the production ?
then also our politicians to measure .
obviously , what 's the resources ?
how do this kind of gather together ?
we need a basic aspect of course , the resources , finally to put and not the work .
who here especially those entrepreneurs of you , but also the employees to understand this very good .
what kind of control , irrespective of knowledge that we really a colleague paid for .
you could really do differently .
the resources , some sort of reduces and therefore we are the resources tax adviser and not the work .

it works , but since we need to sort of a little hard .
that means that conclusion , sort of looking at all levels can radically toward that worked out , we can think hard , we can be monitored the right products , services as a consumer sort of us to ask what we need to actually how do that what 's acting as good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the right politics , choosing the constraint set .
some evidence i 've been .
and finally , and also the science <unk> percent of science is still in the way , how do we the growth drive ?
so , but nobody has done .
if you the projections look if you to develop the look at the last 20 years , it 's all down because it does n't go .
the politics does n't and the science is not growth happen , but this is the question how do we put in order , which was so that we have a good life form of people have ?
so that 's dance , do it .

with heart , the brain , hand and finally , of spirit we 're going to need .
so much .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love the city .
this city has so many of stories .
one of which has a few hundred years happened .
so , and to do with creative problem-solving .
this creative problem-solving , i get away , and on the story about later .
they will have to deal with the fortress <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , which are in the middle of the city is , and lots of this city respond to mind and changes .
another story about earlier .
it was on a hot <unk> to reno , nevada .
a man knows how at once in his shoes so right there are right <unk> .
for him to 's warm .
it 's all europeans , he knows that not so with the heat .
he does so one he pulls the shoe of taking a knife <unk> not too long spike in , and across times makes where several holes in .
he pulls the room , back to have to the global knives way and notice he has a new climate in shoe .
it 's the room that 's breathing , born .
and this number that you see here 's the point in the <unk> of these billionaires are in the morton <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> born , with four letters .
the one or some of you know it .
he 's the original idea nike even and adidas are offered .
both have it down .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> it goes on the stock market .
practice now several thousand in the company in short <unk> business in about <unk> country in the world .
so much on creative problem-solving .
why not something to reinvent fire , what else is not here ?
and super mario question has moved maybe the question to settle <unk> shortchange audience .
if you <unk> n't know , it 's what 's an opportunity ?
this question that has i 've often work , in tough situation .
if something wrong , mit 's or my collaborator heralds me and technology does n't or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what 's an opportunity ?
and now you come from <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> `` i get with this example here to illustrate .
and another example by the <unk> <unk> collected about that , the <unk> statements about <unk> .
and the evidence , as imaginative people can be when it 's about their own insurance does .
i want to a few examples here indicated .
they 're actually so responding with the <unk> <unk> and that has become as a commercial done .
i <unk> ' the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , so , the woman from the <unk> <unk> .
and i had all day , plants <unk> when i the intersection had reached , growing a sudden a bush in my vision and i get the other vehicles do n't see .
clearly , who this guilt is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been and two times nearly died .
so you can i do <unk> half the <unk> cash .
the last i was to the crash n't blame .
debt was the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man , there 's each other kinds anymore .
but if you a woman who are now do it might not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish and i dream of that we all more of that creativity can use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and this may not be .
why not things just going to do differently ?
old stuff that we do that kind of routine have become that gives you might be bored , or <unk> , the opposite .
why are not just going to do differently , the <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> companies that used that .
for example <unk> who have yet these <unk> of their leaders are , these signs , you look at the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what it .
one way , right ?
once the coffee order to stay instead of <unk> .
or something .
we have no <unk> , <unk> you .
's already <unk> , right ?
if you the device not something type in .
or eat them with me , you were starving , we both .
being rude , but creative .
so we need something that one .
i about ' one of the users or <unk> the then go would and say , okay , this is liking .
this <unk> `` i get out .
a <unk> <unk> has in the <unk> the current published <unk> that , in <unk> .
once the sport that once the current news , once upon politics .
if you get there <unk> on the loo was , one is <unk> .
even got the complaint about too long <unk> eating .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all of hands are committed to do .
it was too close .
they 've got together , what we do ?
how we solve the problem ?
we can not faster elsewhere in the kitchen .
this idea is created .

so that the <unk> in the waiting to go eat their <unk> , for themselves wo could .
just going to different .
a creative thinking , and maybe with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person who does represent not only unpopular .
you that person is the leader of <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and we 're now <unk> yes , the german orbit .
already the other day , it takes a monday , so four days .
a company is vastly <unk> the staff of the month , chosen , and you know , maybe that .
a <unk> says , rather vastly rich , we thank you .
people come to consider <unk> .
the buses , filled it will <unk> run , people to organize themselves in a carpool for each of course , for other ways to find out of a to b to come .
but why not going to date to use and creatively from his disadvantage do ?
sometimes what happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe out there 's like this company that you may .
so we 've known that there are at the <unk> n't really goes well , but that look at the <unk> already also save it 's something <unk> .
or at <unk> the car .
because we 've seen the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why does n't go grab a bacon the car , subscribe to get <unk> is ?
or at <unk> 's also opening up , the creative design of .
and all that has to do just with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son in my office .
and sitting on this <unk> behind me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then she turns out of the left , right , and he 'd be happy , and i in my stinking <unk> tell him . '' to you , listen to , that 's not a playground here .
it to me , looking at me , big eyes , playground .
and the moment <unk> ' i actually did he 's right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground .
why is what we do n't the playground for grown-ups ?
this about as much self-driving rather , right ?
if we are relaxed , if we our talents to use that do what we want to do .
and so <unk> revenue , but very comfortable .
and to be idiosyncratic is that whenever a particular day the week 's going to change what our brains .
it 's the first day a week and some point is our focus on another day .
so another day we usually prefer .
so towards the weekend .
that you hear it 's already in the media .
on thursday 's said yes , only one day until the weekend .
or when the nicest day , the year announced , the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
do that dreadful ?
we 've got this terrible jobs ?
a <unk> had about it on the cover a chance to this topic .
yes , monday , could do i and the rest of life you ask myself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , anywhere in social networks is this topic taken .
once <unk> i went through the <unk> , one of <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of businesses and i look to me the likes to .
what did the way in the <unk> , which there 's something ?
and one day <unk> i , this business with these signs to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , that 's actually quite neat .
so , by using this love to do instead of work .
i <unk> it also , my father of five children , but i love with my work anymore .
yes .
and still working for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why your mindset that it 's degree ideas , which was always more and continue .
somebody has given time as an answer to the direction posted it 's not a monday , it 's your jobs .

what about my job is beautiful ?
this silly , even though it the pink , glasses , it 's all right now when they were .
so something nice to talk to do that 's beautiful , it 's clearly not .
the pink , glasses 's actually great , biking .
there holding them a wonderful from the flies off that otherwise the eye on land were .
but to <unk> the advice you do n't .
where does this all , if we do n't change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , out when we 're self-sufficient .
it ends up , maybe in a system where we like us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this wheel , and heads and heads and is , and eventually , interestingly , too fast , this wheel it hits the poor mouse and they go bad thing out .
what makes the mouse but ?
you know how do anything else , you go back to him in the <unk> .
and over and then perhaps the movie day greets that <unk> do you might mean when you know , soft .
that 's nice <unk> here with hay , so it 's doing out there failure and it 's all over and so this field .
and what we as funny feeling probably has the mouse , branch of concussion , yeah ?
or something needs it sure that <unk> <unk> .
it was many years ago so when i arrive , was from a seminar home .
and we have turned around the street under , i felt it was completely black from my eyes and somehow got 'em , i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is because this ?
he looked me and said , `` uh-uh , it 's physically fixed everything in order .
but it looks left with <unk> like ?
and i looked into my calendar , in order to test this , and saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow <unk> me , the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first in the early ta ask whether we 're at night before the end of can do .
so i also thought , what 's pretty much else to jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again other priorities to me to see that i time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me tell do .
<unk> ' or that 's not <unk> other <unk> are in my job , it 's another spark .
i have noted , the talks about , a large groups who do i 've got joy .
i make 'em up as a counseling and <unk> and other things , but the talks impulses that matter to get to experience to exchange , who prepare me exactly joy .
and that was not the time .
i gave myself recognizing that we need that this <unk> stress sick leave .
and sometimes need it right this shot off the bug so , <unk> of mine 's degree away from the hospital was , after having a <unk> have had and at once he starts off on also , <unk> .
earlier than i said , you leave with some jogging , he let me forever <unk> , yes , you with your running and so .
now he is itself .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but eventually we wo n't share jogging go .
what ?
and ultimately will we all , healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the amount of is the conditions , because of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the <unk> last 10 years , <unk> almost call minus fifty percent , that 's nice , which is shrinking .
rise of psychiatric disorders plus <unk> percent .
this is something where i think , let 's such true ?
why is that ?
this is just in austria as ?
no , even in germany , as it .
<unk> , and circulatory system , this is all , healthier .
this is so here on the left to recognize .
bottom of mental illness almost plus a hundred percent in the last decade , finds a big german <unk> out .
the number of <unk> <unk> speeds up .
also the cost .
and it 's think about all kinds of formal , what we can do with this topic ?
do you make suggestions or sometimes form that too involuntary <unk> , like here .
so there are well-intentioned .
and somebody once said , no alcohol abuse is no solution .
but what is the answer ?
what is what we can , but again , healthy power and function and happy to do ?
and that made me that has taken her .
i was able to think there 's something like <unk> , there 's something we can’t be ?
i 'm <unk> , the job is not what we <unk> function and so happy to make them .
there are many other things that 's important , family , health , think , etc .
but in fact is that we the most of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do , why not like what do that we can be happy face and also lets them .
the <unk> <unk> `` i get them <unk> ' and lastly , you may provide a way <unk> and to <unk> in .
these little shortcuts to the people to hopefully will be easier to see .
<unk> is for the talent , manifestation of freedom and environment .
so , like <unk> `` i get my talent that ?
what kind of environments make 'em , i 'm going to do with whom ?
which is free got me here , to do what i 'm trying to do ?
because it 's the level of <unk> , of us <unk> .
the more of the more stress .
and what i do this ?
the realization .
there are these four areas .
and it can everyone for himself test .
i had to the top of my wonderful review in front few years , and i do that routinely again .
can i mean talents to use ?
in which the environment ?
and this is , sometimes i go into a cafe on my laptop to the seminar ready or a <unk> .
the freedom .
which is free and i can take in order to do what i there 's important .
and i should i left at ?
the realization .
the last u ''
and it 's over again , people to explain why this is n't go .
and why that you very much harder is .
then i usually just like an answer in this spot .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't have reasons .
and ideally , at the digit you can choose <unk> ' i ways to find `` i get roads or got me why ?
and they 're in both are right .
what do we do with our talent ?
now , you have his great <unk> catch .
that 's too small .
which is filled with talent , using gold , with everything , with their skills .
what do this ?
ideally a year we wonder that .
or if we have to hospitals are lower or end of life .
what i started with my talent doing ?
anyhow , who here 's really has to <unk> <unk> , can be happy to become one more access .
so what we do with our talent , is so my first question , even at me tell that , for every day .
<unk> `` i get the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
so i tell you wanted to <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i went to stand still reproducing .

and the enemy to feel that the fortress the best they built was that you do n't take could .
thick walls steep ways that <unk> the fortress , thick doors to find <unk> , many times <unk> .
was <unk> ago .
so i thought about the following , okay if we do n't <unk> , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no longer out and in .
let 's how long , ' that there bear .
the <unk> it was some of long until the day came , where the supplies most consuming these caves .
they had just a <unk> who was already on the way to mind to be as the <unk> at once the bishop says , [ bishop give me this <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you <unk> , i <unk> ' you come to hold your <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to <unk> way .
suddenly see the bottom of the enemies how about the wall of the fortress is a <unk> moved to being led to happen again and right to left and already in the early .
well , say , which , a <unk> , which is that now .
it 's afternoon .

enemies are thinking , oh , who has two more <unk> , it can do something else that accomplish .
at night the same experience and again , this is he knows the <unk> that there on and as soon led to happen .
end of the second day , after the six different <unk> saw the bottom dressed you in a <unk> off .
because they thought that takes us too late that we hold themselves are not from .
then went the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one that they were having failures and they <unk> have .
it 's the <unk> <unk> created .
i like this idea that everything there 's what we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes you it narrowed resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's time .
but also so we could n't do something .
we have no idea of the power that we have the world a day i went to invent .
and if you believe that might expect me a good <unk> be they then right .
released , is the spring .
the situation .
and we in europe know , really suck the snow there will get hotter can catch the plants from teens , brown <unk> to green <unk> of this .
there are blooms eventually come from these blooms of those fruits .
there are apples -- here 's very popular which then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain could we will grind and bread for baking .
there are there any animals that can eat .
there 's people who then the products just goes out to grow food .
and it 's automatically .
but if you think about that might not just automatically join everything is then it 's a fear and anxious .
and surely is the threat may very ambiguous and also very theory , but just in terms of these blooms of the connection of the flower to the plant are other bees a very , really matter much .
there 's research that indicate that up to <unk> percent of our food , certain foods n't there were when we do n't make bees had .
now this sounds like <unk> , because it took a normal for us , and we maybe bees do n't that sense .
there was now while ago also a very interesting movie , <unk> , this subject .
and i recommend you , look at it .
now , but really excited we look at the lord <unk> of which was doing with honeybees are working with the person in his school , in <unk> the importance of bees , much power .
he does here at a school at <unk> and he will let 's something about his work to tell you .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first a big , thanks to mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .

and it also under a wing of <unk> something about little <unk> to tell the fun .
because i think to put that the least of them <unk> realm is about here tonight is a <unk> prevent them in eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping bring to pick .
it should not me , no .
but maybe it feeds on me , you to get them to these <unk> start to love or a sense of empathy go to you to develop and you to engage in this <unk> genuine , <unk> insect 's <unk> .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years kid growing up with a wonderful woman , married father of five children 's not going <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> college and work for <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in a charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working here in a garden in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> 's actually a play by <unk> <unk> and is about <unk> <unk> .
our my classroom is a more <unk> , a quiet , steady of thing .
and she runs a while retired .
it 's almost a <unk> matter .
and not free have been the greeks the relationship between the honey and so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping poets and then use to inspire , we 're going back dense in .
but the <unk> go there was n't understand myself down , but they send their blue , bees and <unk> now the poet the lips , like to wax and they crawl into the mouth in and back out with him later the words like honey from <unk> flow .
a nice image .
hopefully be thinking about this tonight .
yes .
a flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the right now my students with me have built up for 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> to college or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> to <unk> .
a <unk> to <unk> or in <unk> we had in <unk> .
the teacher that this project , accompanied walks me up in the class , we search of light bulb place for such a <unk> .
mostly at the window to the children will be able to look at this month .
now , and all things , that the bees , which then in there are working through inner tube out and again <unk> can .
there are then at the window of the slot , created .
so .
and then starting to run the at me on <unk> .
i guess so as a <unk> and jump 'em my right away from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and i 'm now you here in these <unk> muscle .
important in this on this <unk> are <unk> so bees .
also important , we have here <unk> migrate , and here to the side , fresh migrate to be so fresh eggs .
and then also `` a <unk> , up here .
there is the honey and this thing .
the use them as a bad weather is and do n't you can fly .
so .
this is that it .
then the <unk> here 's going on and begins immediately the transportation of going to <unk> places , you look at devising <unk> place in school .
and now start something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees inside the wind up with the rest are experiencing a sudden a crisis .
her people 's no longer .
they are lonely .
you find your queen 's not .

there 's not on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they start to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , you <unk> .
you hear this .
it exactly sums of almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen live .
and now starting a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in one night and developing now you now the need to a new to people , and start the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without looking at conferences , having conversations , regardless of opinions and reflection .
here is the people agree and educating them in the first night is something called <unk> .
because without the queen going to this nation after six weeks , no longer exist .
because <unk> live only six weeks ' worth .
so .
and in the first night , drag them from one of <unk> a pin out an egg , and bring that into this <unk> muscle .
and there <unk> do then <unk> queen going .
anyone who are going to <unk> in the high school had to say , how do that go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , there 's all genetically <unk> .
that basis .
and now start something wonderful .
this egg what 's normally in the <unk> a worker reply was going to <unk> a queen .
the egg does the first three days of the same genetic code at the way <unk> .
then it gets fed by a <unk> <unk> .
you know that term .
and immediately you might be on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier that have heard that what we eat , it determines what of us will .
and where the queen 's really wonderful to experience .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and so might engage students all <unk> .
it 's in class .
and then that cell becomes <unk> with a <unk> wax and all this happens then do n't believe , because the people now democratically in a decision , because one <unk> says , so it should be , or you <unk> a group saying , you do that now .
no , which is <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , which is a <unk> or a <unk> loop .

and a day , if that then so we should happen , the teacher , the wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> in the students in the morning about five o'clock , yes .
and then he says the mother , tell time , which is you used to go ?
yes , i need to school .
yes , why do that ?

yeah ?
and then the morning about six in school .

and if they actually can experience then hear it first thing .
the queen <unk> .
so .
this a little higher .
and you have the <unk> and cut the queen going free .
the first , what the queen , what they spread her wings and it 's now with their <unk> that people what to put yourself a queen of interest has its smell , you <unk> , their pheromones .
the people now has been an identity .
now , three to five days , the queen fed .
by the <unk> the front of it gets their <unk> <unk> .
adding that comes the dung out , from people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , stick the queen singular of the <unk> out .
others think now , yes , i 've seen , for , such a <unk> in <unk> .
wait , stop .
what different .
-- that we have .
the queen 's going to blame ourselves without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
you have surely thought already seen in your zeppelin .
in the <unk> and get there in a <unk> <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so around like in islam is where the man different women have today is the queen , the seven to a dozen men have .
and all this happens in a wonderful way in midair .
the drone will come back of <unk> the queen , and the queen , collects now in this <unk> <unk> all this thing you to seed need to three years to lay eggs .
for the drone is also an amazing experience .
if it 's done with <unk> dies , she falls , dead by the sky .
and then the queen back and starts , to lay eggs .
there are always a , two students in class that it immediately see .
they also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then rounded slow this project in school because now , the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> is going to look closely in there .
and then come i one night , then managed to that <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> from outside , and the next morning jump 'em , i this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there , here it 's the queen .
yes .
fresh <unk> .
and around , most of 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then that yes , these two <unk> get right now here in a <unk> .
in a crowded cane , in a particular prey and then we can use one nation of the size and powerful up .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen the kids that have seen , forget that no longer .
yes .
there 's not only way that in this class then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes in this class in .
and the teacher , when he wanted to know if he was something can , if it when he sits there will be prepared for the can create an era of another plug .
look , bees and <unk> <unk> ago <unk> years we 've <unk> where people have the honey harvest this .
so a few months , you have in israel <unk> year-old <unk> found in which people then the bees thought about .

or vice versa , the bees were at any culture in .

everywhere , they were getting out .
the human culture , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
it can make a <unk> , a <unk> hook , it can make a <unk> join .
ladies and gentlemen , you know what plants or grafting trees the bees <unk> , what you need ?
it out there 's something is think now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , which is a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can touch with students in the <unk> and go out of those flowers were plants , bees messages , on <unk> you mark and see how long need the right away from <unk> to my kids flowers ?
how long they are in the individuals blooms ?
and how long they need to get back to go back .
he can <unk> <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know whether that this is that in the <unk> the top up or it 's <unk> flat side up is ?
look even look carefully .
it can make a mathematics -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with students in fact , the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and he comes to the question is how could karl of fresh <unk> the nobel ever get ?
because he took me that the bees that look at the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive if it 's dark .
there is also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , the many years in <unk> in the university teaching has the have in <unk> to discover that the bees are going on a <unk> create a single <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax in the <unk> a <unk> done , and then with <unk> hertz their <unk> there cost , and the bees , the <unk> to pick up with your legs , with their <unk> .
you see what these bees in school do ?
it 's <unk> par excellence , and the kids drop their fear of the bees .
and develop an awareness of the bees .
they learn that <unk> , look what the bees do .
and they got aware of these creatures which basically just for our lives .
the bees do wax do n't even a kilo of a nation of a year .
before <unk> years the only way , candles make .
they accumulate in the <unk> out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , with <unk> them their people like .
and now imagine time ago , in summer , these are <unk> -- that <unk> bees on as an inner space , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's <unk> without end .
no , in the bees do n't .
because they were in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and as you to him that ferment , it gets to <unk> , a quality <unk> .
somebody who are at the <unk> disease is that gets pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and a <unk> prescribe this , by the <unk> from people <unk> .
obviously there 's a lattice of mankind and with <unk> with a <unk> and so forth , because nothing happens .
yes , and then , ladies and gentlemen and pollinating the agricultural do that the bees and also and we had a few apples , if the bees were n't fly would or we 'd like chinese is happening on the <unk> <unk> and they themselves and pollinating .
there 's much larger context .
look at <unk> , out there on the meadow 's also the growing up the alders where the cows graze again .
and there are flying through the bee up to bring himself takes nectar and fermented -- these <unk> .
and here 's the cow and eats the <unk> and just because they <unk> <unk> input , it can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> your neck again and notice , ah , yes , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can go back <unk> .
and then there was milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and in conclusion provided the bee followed us the most of what it on the world with the nature makes .
the honey .
i want more quickly to the point , get <unk> .
my students to enjoy each year , if you put <unk> build and then some with me in the schools goes .
that 's not going to my <unk> but , i had a student at and since i said in <unk> in college in <unk> and said , you , <unk> ' store , you yourself before .
and so he says , yeah well , i hot ' <unk> <unk> .
i 'm from <unk> at <unk> and i 'm twenty years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and since two years when thomas in <unk> .
and i really excited about me that i 'm not anymore at the <unk> learning needs , but with your hands can learn .
<unk> , yes , on the head .

and more than half of said , oh yeah , we want that 's .

on ; look at and you have confidence , my students and a certain proud .
how you go to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you 'd say , as you go to <unk> the <unk> ?
and i think about , i also there 's kind of us , the other people <unk> and it a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , lead to begin .
the end up a little poem by <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee is the sun across the <unk> feel the way to flower to engage and never the direction lose the <unk> the fields in <unk> gleam as soon as it was he would have rarely cry .
so much .
hello , dear friends on earth .
so welcome to present my project .
the project my sighted person and my wife .
it 's the struggle for an end of female <unk> .
in my view of the greatest crimes of humanity , because it <unk> been <unk> years .
the society against the women who were still <unk> sacrifices every day .
first <unk> ' i imagined .
my name is <unk> , i come in hamburg ?
there i <unk> years a <unk> leaders .
you can imagine having me the job , not <unk> has .
i felt n't <unk> .
and so i was glad that i 'm in the theme <unk> well <unk> and exciting has to cross the could .
for example this .
with a massive <unk> about the atlantic powers of africa to brazil .

this was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
anyway , such has to be eligible to the interest in the media to find and even a small person as i could change your priority worldwide for language , right ?

then there was there war between <unk> and ethiopia and we had a bystander at the killings there .

and twice as it transpired that we invaded were and our two <unk> that you see here to empathize with their bodies as living <unk> before us <unk> , and the attackers with said that 's my <unk> .
if you want to kill you want to have to her around us through it shoot .
something similar back in any other cultures are found .
and then there were young already learned that islam is not can reduce to terrorism .
and christians do n't be reduced to with terrorism .
for example of the <unk> .
the inquisition , the <unk> .
but rather on the true value of charity , social responsibility that <unk> .
these are the values , for example , it 's worth to fight .
after many years is me again in this <unk> been , it with my wife <unk> .
and since we heard come from this <unk> female <unk> .
when i heard that <unk> percent of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> got about i thought about how can a <unk> like , islam , besides all of terror also about that <unk> in the shoes to push now ?
and the idea was born in the top leaders of islam to get the needs to sin to explain .
we went to use cymatics is in german organizations that we did n't found .
because we took us then read now we would n't be completely <unk> , of islam is not <unk> .

on <unk> for amnesty , and internationally , we then <unk> our own organization is created .
and were of <unk> and <unk> independent .
and now to this battle , even to win to do we needed to reconcile .
it was a scarcity .
and therefore we moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to hidden camera these pictures to make .
the horrid gory images which i show not , but i want to divert the crime drawing .

what you left is an open up from the size of <unk> .
connected takes now one <unk> .
when they typically get torturing her , you two weeks .
unimaginable wiped out of body and soul , deprived their dignity .
it was the beginning of so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> you go on .
the man has to you open .
he has never been a <unk> woman who saw .
the uncle , he said , oh , ibrahim , there 's no problem .

and when you do n't create , is nothing wrong .
then <unk> you the knife and <unk> them .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of girls .
that you had three months ago mutilated .
in shock , the girl puts his language is lost .
this is that <unk> , some in asia .

and whenever we muslims were asked , why did you this done ?
was the <unk> answer that we have to do that 's the koran .
nothing is the koran , of all the opposite .
each of believing <unk> <unk> day in prayer , such singular allah , the creator , is , perfect , <unk> .
but they seem to believe what you there praying .
they assume allah , a <unk> to be women 's wrong has created and why you just as <unk> person <unk> might think of the women <unk> .
but now we had the images of the first and cymatics had the sultan .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there was hard discussions , two days .
but we had the minister of our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great decision , the practice is against all rights to , that religion , we need to give a minute .
as recently , the way the sultan this new <unk> signed .

and it was celebrating and these successes , we came up in other countries .
quick example here , <unk> there <unk> us , the highest spiritual leader who <unk> country 's his message that there is a crime , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
weeks , we were traveling with your camels .
hundreds <unk> , we came along .
and where we came , we 've just open ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality 1953 .
and when we the country , branch left to say , the great scholars or <unk> <unk> , you want to actually now all <unk> countries work ?
so much , life is of allah you do n't be more .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and i mean , you start to pull from .
and mostly he had an idea .
he said , when it you could , the ten <unk> muslims the world at a table to bring out and explain the needs to sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew over cairo to the <unk> and , mosque similar to the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened to the idea of was thrilled , especially when we saw him assured , that we finance community .
and we do you know about equal-opportunity provider , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm the conference , not just <unk> , as we asked him , but i 'm the <unk> destiny .
and that he did .
over cairo <unk> sometime in <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to ban the <unk> of female body through cut .
under the <unk> of <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> .
and all you 're running .
hundreds <unk> , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men who live and death decide to .
but also `` the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> right is the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about whom i 'm going <unk> me just a vacuum ago , allah personal .
and then i you guys to turn .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of the wife , mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much subject of islam is not <unk> .

and then had to <unk> your film shows , <unk> .
reality .
the men were getting wet eyes .
they went to go back behind <unk> doors to just two hours , you had decided , and a fatwa , written a <unk> .
the <unk> jumps off the cameras , announced , what you decided to .
and the most powerful set of course , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime that for high value of islam <unk> .
he autograph the fatwa .
we thought , the job , i 've done yet the calculus , without our <unk> done .
because the shame , over the abdomen the woman to talk about is deeply moved as any mind .
so we <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in this was called crazy gold book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and so , ali <unk> , the <unk> , it just found that book , he has to take a preamble blessed .
it gets us from the hands , tore itself .
we were in many countries had to go to conferences , holding up with each highest clergy .
and you read this with interest in some were so excited that it 's book <unk> have .
unfortunately , but , most not the courage put on that now also to announce that .
over the abdomen the woman must be no one in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage put on .
they 're <unk> in universities are gone , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have a bold <unk> found that actually in the mosque about <unk> have , like here .
and then it out of speakers in the <unk> .
and this , yes , the subjects .
they 're actually diffuse .
but i 'm running out of time .
it 's all drop of hot rocks , and so i work on a lot of strategies , this issue more <unk> .
the practice eliminating .
but my <unk> do think this .
i want the neat word of the highest clergy the world to announce the birthplace of islam actually here by the kaaba in mecca .
not at so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
so here four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> `` i get with all the people and the <unk> king of my transparent go between the minarets contract .
how is what i have trained to have in the <unk> .
unfortunately , do n't even the last <unk> think this was the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure that if they 're talking about <unk> he would join .
one of these women to help .
the second thing to conclude the time to show , which is the real value of islam , instead of parenting always present on .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't manage to then <unk> ' i might this thing in hamburg , given time had .
that <unk> many <unk> in the mosque agree on earth .
and we transparent and contract can .
and maybe we live , i that stuff that this little girl puts his daughters no longer <unk> to .
it 's my life so right off .

i do n't participate 's an <unk> .
we need to practice in the a ton of strike , because i put me here from this stage just not occurring .
and now i want them in closing the concept of my <unk> before them .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all <unk> up there arabic , on behalf <unk> of <unk> and <unk> this must always say .
go down and we 're going to be in german .
female <unk> about the koran , and the ethic of islam incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thanks .
so i got 'em just so what happens .
so they saw the <unk> out that you a refugee camps in germany had .

it made a <unk> .
my mother was completely terrified , because they do n't understand it 's why we are now rotten food have given .
the third day we did finally get resolved .
we stood in the trash to the stuff again . throw this was a <unk> wife and <unk> that easy to <unk> out .
they tried to us to explain bless you can eat .
this is not spoil it .
it tastes actually really good .
it 's cheese .
my mom took the brow and if we laughed .
cheese .
in my homeland , we have that goat but it has not so <unk> air .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years i 'm going to my mother and my brother of china to germany fled .
outside of the evasion <unk> ' today i tell you .
but importantly , it 's me about to the people to escape from happening , and to a success did .
but first thought `` i get them , where i just come .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> that make the northwest of china 's life .
and this region grows by the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china life , collectively add 10 million <unk> but in munich is the most <unk> community grow outside of china .
and this <unk> life so here because we 're in china under constant <unk> ailments have .
hundreds of chinese were extra for <unk> relocated to us in our own home to a minority have become .
our own tongue , <unk> turned out of education system eliminated .
in schools and in university will only chinese taught .
and our religion can we also not free drives .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and when someone is courageous , and for the right the <unk> handled may have long sentences torture , or even die .
it was also the reason that my parents for 've decided to us with kids to flee .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this photo is coming up of the evasion of come .
we did n't enough money , so i had my father 's first time left .
i <unk> ' at me many people who look at the run that have changed .
i <unk> ' at me many paintings .
i <unk> feed me , but first of <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just do it just before me , if i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had <unk> <unk> on , over and we met him up with his little lada on a lot .
the first rate was over .
i know that many of a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business with refugees abuse and there 's not for the fates to be interested .
but i 'd ' `` i 'd do it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .

he stood the airport in <unk> on a <unk> so , and by the past conclusions <unk> if we also really safe from the <unk> came .
airport in <unk> we came up in and i remember , as my mother in a way to me saying goes straight out of the airport .
is n't begin to .
until we are out .
because i had kind of my hand a hey , and there was also my photo inside , but it had an alien name , <unk> .
i had better than <unk> through the <unk> .

silence .
sweat .
a long view .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich came <unk> `` i get me of a lot of workers have , we somehow were backed up .
i <unk> feed me of the <unk> woman who inspire us in <unk> used to .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> full-size families .
least forty children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was stranger faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
this is eaten , slept and done homework .
friends did not going to visit because i <unk> where we lived .
just my <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> knew anything .
they knew my story and ostensibly in i really and you care about me .
for example , she brought me to <unk> <unk> now what i do n't do .
but it helped me , nor somehow , german <unk> meet .
i spent all my adolescence in <unk> .
it was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with our children with her husband and been in the uncertainty because we did n't just a factions , and could always was deported be .
i <unk> ' to be that i really , really aggressive was at the time .
it 's me a bit embarrassed , this now there anything to tell , but i need now just to my story are .
i was extremely aggressive and brought me in school bad somehow an issue .
they brought him go undercover agent with a catholic <unk> where we first started to normal young children in touch were .
using normal my `` i get kids who not a <unk> 're living had .
i <unk> ' i also on the <unk> the me with my brother to <unk> or <unk> sent .
just so we bit <unk> .
i <unk> ' i also on several <unk> <unk> to us done homework , because our parents do n't speak german , could .
or the have to us to actually painted .
we 've always very happy .
i remember how we 're always before the fence stood and waited until these people came up , because , somehow i took the foreign people for us time , and they were used to be important .
after two years , finally got my father to germany .
this problem , but that it comes straight from <unk> to <unk> deported was because it in munich supposedly , no way more for him out there .
i <unk> feed me of the ancient , engaged lawyer who has managed to my father before the <unk> to china to protect us they made it in fact that would look at us in munich 're living zone .
i <unk> ' at me this time when i really started getting very , very happy , because after six years <unk> could we finally in a standard apartment there .
we got a <unk> for three years and we had finally worked with my own apartment at your bad and of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was very small and i had no news desk in there , but it was good , i could my door gates .
and i <unk> feed me that i the time , yes , very well used to have , but i did n't yet the <unk> without a degree to leave .
i looked for me really no way .

first <unk> then the <unk> .
i because the teachers who really want to me thought bruises and i was really not just by the time , i managed even to the middle <unk> .
then i came to <unk> .
and before i have to <unk> came i played dealing with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was a great <unk> that got about i only be done because we get through <unk> a place had where we just going to sign .
we had a valve what we do our aggression <unk> could .
and the head of <unk> helped us kind of us to our problems him tell you could and he was ostensibly us and brought us to everybody asking some <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without a degree the ability to get the artistic <unk> .
it made me personally really well done , and i have noted , art is something which i also bit <unk> .
by <unk> and the contact with <unk> got a filmmaker , upon us .
he made the movie <unk> about life of my friends and me .
and the movie , won lots of prices .
we discovered that people to our history interesting .
he was a very special feeling , because we never had experienced that people were listening have .
and that was such a moment where i thought , okay .

i want something from my life make .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees came up on the idea for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> travel .
but since i have in bold building me totally immersed in order to have landed , i happened in a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one through four .
so i was right .
i played with .
and the great is that after a performance alongside two editors was taken <unk> <unk> on me plethora of .
and wondering , had if i got interest should just going to own <unk> to make .
i said , super , <unk> .
anybody would go `` i get with .
and i did for the <unk> <unk> now , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , where i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> placed .
and i told him too actually won .
now to study i went to school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> already in third year and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and it all be for me not been possible if not individual or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me to apply the time .
they have to me believe you made me spaces open , you made me ways it said , i see my place in society me <unk> can .
and to come ' i 'm going to them .
now , you have the way of people like to help me second chance to get and their lives or her place in society to find .
because that people to undertake to get <unk> hundreds of refugees in munich , and now , you 're dealing with hope and now , you have a potential .
they did it with big determination done many terrible hurdles that behind them on .
and with this determination , they could really big profit for germany , and be for each of us too .
and i could actually thousands of things tell you can do , but since i do n't enough time , although it says , a minute their 40s , i asked them a <unk> brought .

we scan them the code and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities where their nations can do .
and this would look pretty good help .
i <unk> 'm just for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan them the code within one .
i just do it .
many have the device not in the hand .
are you so <unk> become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
first one <unk> greeting for me .
excites me that we can touch it .
my name is robin chase .
my <unk> is write a simpler than it may speak .
i 'll get 'em up of austria , which is in vienna .
i 'm excited about me still very , today in <unk> be able to get that 's really beautiful here .
i <unk> me here every time very well .
and that 's not a phrase that 's a sense .
yes , yes , as opposed to the other <unk> i 'm not here today to tell you about anything to <unk> .
i knew why not what .
but it 's so that i 'm writing was writing to build my and these up anywhere talk about , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or indeed <unk> like the present .
yes , and i was also today , asked , so a few texts <unk> to run the program a little <unk> .
and this wind ' i 'm going to do here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
and meet each other two chicken .

says the other , yeah .
hey <unk> ca n't <unk> <unk> .
here we would have the levels of organized .
the first text is a little <unk> that i 've written got about .
i got about it was a person is devoted to me , part , which means that .
it carries the title <unk> .
and well , it 's why did n't understand myself the robot .
when your head in my lap , there was sleeping out your rest of my ceiling .
my leg , she was under my ceiling with your leg , there was outside the top .
my leg got long across the ceiling .
it 's about your head is hold on my lap dear , the rest of it under the ceiling , my leg as well under the ceiling , your leg out the top .
this has <unk> , as about my leg got extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the next to text back and then one person is devoted to me , very much does .
and while my grandpa .
we 've since no contact all over .
my <unk> grandfather was from career has a butcher .
already at the child has it with love <unk> cut .
gets me just like this , yes .
yes , even 'n text .
get better the not .
jesus is the only big savior is at the little sticker for the glass of the bus .
but where i 'd seen jesus as it myself from that sticker <unk> `` save you want ?
there to think , yeah ?
so i mean <unk> already taken ?
range of text .
the next to text is slightly longer .
he takes actually a half hours .
so to write .
reading it gets faster .
's the beginning of a novel that i have degrees in the <unk> write . ''
ah , it 's about <unk> guy , so the man from a guy who keeps the hair <unk> and a little too much <unk> .
i <unk> feed me , but again at this point aware of <unk> i distance .
because i 'd ' i 'd never the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> will my head empty .
so low as the paper that he was going to fill up to try .
yeah , so forth , i 'm not be .
very hard half hours .
the next to text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't know .
i do about myself too hard .
and that is that , i play `` love with my vocabulary and with my language .
i got always likes to me playing .
and well , you have taken those things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
's a bit strange yet , the epic .
is probably the <unk> <unk> that i always been written reports .
<unk> we can .
yes , we cans .
we all can .
we <unk> .
<unk> i ca n't .
but i can go .
i can not found .
i can not .
yes , i did the wonderful inspiration does n't understand .
no idea .
yes , yes , clap of me out .
i tell ' time , either all or no .
the next sheet was also think of text to do .
is a way , such a little <unk> .
i got the time for the insects were written .
very polite .
yes , even 'n text .
is a little <unk> .
and it 's about cool whenever i do n't do you for three words might be .
my text which carries the title , all good stuff is cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we must <unk> .
so we need to cuddle this , <unk> , <unk> and scraping and then it all the better and well , it was left .
beautiful of collaborative movement .
yes , even 'n <unk> , that 's having a different .
and it 's about cool whenever i just kidding about that we all so <unk> kind <unk> could do n't know , 'n let 's all time .
right , so that what the wind power to wait .
the text which carries the title <unk> and go so here .
yes .
fun with you .
the <unk> text is just one sentence .
i write about something like little <unk> .
this is a <unk> sexual pun .
sexual about <unk> s written .
sharp s ?
yes , yes .
fun with you .
yes , even 'n sentence .
this is in <unk> written .
is a very long last sentence .
i find almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain this is the point .
here , you just a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he was already known to me before him as such <unk> have .
he got me purpose of short woken up , then he would me <unk> real time .
i ca n't help me later still in him <unk> .
i gave him the joy done .
it as <unk> ago , every other days <unk> and me back to sleep in the area .
with a <unk> grin as we face where else ?
and purpose , did n't want to greater honor , i make <unk> .
and i was later , but back up ; it can do n't take a <unk> day , and commercialized this .
gives hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little kid .
what she said to albert einstein , when he may be eating steak n't taste ?
i <unk> .
so .
letter <unk> sounds like the cow .
it 's why this funny .
yes , the next to text that does this paper memorized learned .
is more what political .
so , i write do n't just fun things .
i write about also partially very political things .
and across to wind ' i often wondered where i <unk> in .
and , yeah , there got me just this text is written .
he carries the title <unk> .
my father came from vienna , in my mother and i made her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thanks for the sound .
yes , at this point would `` why do some advertising is done .
i ca n't a business card or so do is why i have to the time <unk> do .

can feel like to look next round .
and well , i <unk> ' , i <unk> ' actually much more likable .
and , yeah .
that you want to `` i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more apps .
this is a little advertisement that i 've written reports .
feet .
rich with vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin toe .
stayed quite fun .
i want to feed a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend could write but the kicker was just a flat .
yes , is not a degree of my <unk> .
<unk> you <unk> a to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> a to make the <unk> out of it .
yes .
thanks for listening .
you were terrific .
thanks , ladies and gentlemen .
let me equals a <unk> question is beginning .
why do you <unk> ever run ?
i think anyone who tax money does n't be wondering if he least some potentially the society which give you .
the answer is clearly .
we know now that the lifespan the moment of birth of only about <unk> percent more genetic <unk> is .
so it has some environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we know it still much less ?
why are we were bombarded by <unk> news from <unk> at the most part one another the ground ?
you remember all about 15 years , it seemed the guilty found .
it was fat .

what to <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , manipulating <unk> in america have grown has led and what do n't be changed that the americans every year 's thicker have become .
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
what happens to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so on has led .
so it 's over again <unk> new <unk> sow and it village <unk> .
how in the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , to my taste to some least , that we go through <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal <unk> to the science and wisdom <unk> .
case for a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> you 've all .
<unk> published a lot <unk> magazine a new rubric .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for coming year .
keith richards was seven years , in the top placed .
then he died of the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest us , flying depending on earth has lived .
<unk> years old today .
i know , there are telling people who claim that they 're <unk> , can but just your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> today .
and they listened to <unk> to smoke started -- but with <unk> time to then finally , with <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue of the consequences and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
which tells us that ?
not know , cigarettes , healthy are .
but it tells us that , aging , very complicated is and that we clean statistics , we need using simple experimental systems and we need simple questions .
<unk> very simple question and a very simple issue that in different countries , preserved is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we do now .
it 's lying on testosterone up <unk> so what in the male <unk> is produced .
and there are <unk> very simple evidence <unk> men are just like this old as women .
can now everybody for yourself think , whether it a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a <unk> country .
but you get better yet tips , not afraid .
general do we all over correlation was with this causality , to do anything .
sounds complicated , but it 's just about traditional <unk> to illustrate .
there was attending so someone <unk> <unk> grandma , and asks what are you doing so different way or not eaten them as old have become ?
ah .
the granny 's every day , tens of cigarettes <unk> .
that is kind of the secret of their ages , right ?
there are tens of cigarettes , maybe just not <unk> .
or but they have <unk> and the granny would n't have 10 most of cigarettes , you may grow .
so hard statistics are not more potent .
there for example <unk> very hard stats that shows that people who <unk> in the <unk> go get older than people who did n't do .
fully functional .
is <unk> .
is that from the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it because data that just people enough money in your pocket have a good for her age and the <unk> diseases to do .
but if i had a group of the lab animals a <unk> to feed admit , and this group with 20 percent live longer than <unk> <unk> the <unk> you do n't get out , but otherwise very same given was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the food being affected .
and actually are trying made .
must say that <unk> 's very <unk> what but even i work with my enemies , agree 'm is that regular <unk> life <unk> .
and this works for all different organisms .
for example of bacteria .
you see <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
if we are <unk> , in the <unk> line showing you live up significantly more .
the same for <unk> , worms fly mice and recently , just about two years in america is shown that was even for the monkey 's .
it 's not about thin to be .
it works in <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's another experiment , which in the united states was done .
what did you did here ?
you have <unk> <unk> took so , and of a so-called <unk> administered to a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> one day and night i got .
and who you wonder about it , these mice are being dick became , sick and have <unk> very bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now you have <unk> parallel <unk> plate and that 's in the very same amount of <unk> fed the only that song <unk> pause every time .
they have the daytime n't eat allowed to make sure you have given night twice as much eating .

so , both animals <unk> fed up .
both have much eating .
the a sick and the other healthy .
what happened there really ?
it 's a process called the cellular <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
whenever they were organisms , cells food you take it captures that organism on , redundant ingredients in the cell or injured ingredients in off to take back in energy do .
that makes sense .
and it looks like .
you can see , in the cell led to <unk> forming a lot of crashed , the during the age <unk> .
the merged , with the stomach , the ingredients are <unk> and the cell as energy back one day in 1966 .
it will you damage the age , accumulate into limits illusion .
this is really the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell us .
so , to sum it regular <unk> <unk> life in different organisms .
and it 's likely to assume that 's also when people work .
and we learn from that you just not sort of <unk> recommended every small <unk> day with 20 <unk> fight are .
no .
but , you want to say , if they 're hungry , ah , maybe is just the <unk> <unk> .
welcome change your hunger as a friend .
and that 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> point nine nine percent of history has the person , what he did , if they were famine had ?
right , he 's hunting gone .
we 're regularly look at the fridge hunting , if we 're hungry all .
and that 's safe to play the biology .

the garden who looks at pretty different .
this kind of <unk> <unk> in a medieval paradise been .
the three <unk> here 's good , the food all day , let 's all those .
and this is sort of the actual <unk> .
we 've become so on the quest for substances in doing that the molecular answer the <unk> detectors , despite the organism , eating .
this could for people might be interesting , whose <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it might think about one of the hardest <unk> of life , secret .
the question is so we can <unk> that <unk> , the extracellular <unk> detectors , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds of the thousand substances in the scans , natural substances .
we have in fact that a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a matter that in all of organisms <unk> sounding the but also in all of organisms in the <unk> less will .
in the skin is the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in the skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells that matter , for example , you see this .
this is <unk> <unk> cell here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> put more and we see how many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell to rise of the crashed , the during the age <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very precisely here .
and it works in different organisms .
here for example , shown on a <unk> .

life because those organisms that even more .
and the answer is again , you see <unk> typical <unk> of a <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are all dead , more and forty days is about half the dead .
whenever we <unk> the water that matter , here in colorful , these animals grow older and surviving better .
we also know that the human cells that we of <unk> <unk> vivo <unk> have in culture about three times as long held , if we want to <unk> know ?
and the latest research , we put too close to be boot-strapping life of all over mice down <unk> <unk> will .
and it 's not only life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are significantly <unk> .
so .
now you want to describe all know , where does <unk> on ?
how the name is already says , it 's the sperm detected , you get it in very high levels off .
but i can you comfort , in <unk> <unk> green pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> what in japan , big <unk> enjoys , this is so <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we 've got to say , if <unk> against <unk> helps them , using it 's -- crashed <unk> helps it may also for <unk> ?
they have fancy you know that the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the age <unk> the brain <unk> .
and we have in fact , these experiments to be done .
they 're wondering , we have to the flies have done .
flies are actually also <unk> , if you get older .
they have more <unk> the brain , if you get older .
and the molecular mechanisms that for remembrance that are dedicated are just like to do .
now think about this yet , like the hell does that guy the memory of flies have measured ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stefan seals from school , berlin who did .
you take a hundred flies and jam it 's a give them one smell , the they love .
<unk> .
and let the wrong in this <unk> <unk> .
then you take the same fly to give them into the next chamber , and give <unk> different smell , the they love , which <unk> .
we let 's the <unk> enjoy , as she said , but <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in classic <unk> .
then you take over the same fly to do now this area .
the driving this degree in the elevator , down there you see the .
and if you have here have arrived , give them from one hand <unk> and of other hand <unk> in .
where i 'm going to all gone ?
right .
the cherry factory .
except the two here .
this is that <unk> .
or , say , you have character .
i love my <unk> and i do ' i 'm not by so <unk> <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
but it 's <unk> form of the realities , with the age increases .
not only in flies .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , level , again .
and the <unk> that in the brain had created , were back to pull out .
so , <unk> does n't just for aging , but for <unk> diseases , potentially .
and that 's important because we want to know the <unk> not the time per se extend .
it 's no point , the time of <unk> to extend .
and i would n't you fired , without them again a few practical tips to give us we might younger stay .
again <unk> <unk> .
it 's not that you gain weight to reduce or anything .
there are actually now in austria <unk> group of <unk> people are a day , eating and a day n't eat .

and the think of the very well through .
so , it 's <unk> .
and avoid it <unk> .
it 's not carbs , da , carbs seem to actually not harmful to be .
it 's really care of candy .

and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors acceleration can .
here it <unk> <unk> that was sitting down ages .
after 30 days are all dead .
very low doses of glucose reach out .
for a <unk> effect of lenses .
there 's just an example , it works in nearly all of organisms that .
you eat regular , fruits and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of too much <unk> or of <unk> ever .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can manage .
it 's not certain circumstances of vitamin d .
we are there might degrees ' in winter a <unk> , because vitamin d is caused by sunlight on the skin is building .
some you least three times per week <unk> half hour of sports , these are trivial .
cigarettes , despite the original <unk> examples of money they <unk> 10 to fifteen years , life .
do you look at times of eternal <unk> occasionally the rest of .
the effect of praying , and <unk> on the lifespan , shows .
because the monks lives almost as long about how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> are still more than <unk> .
just <unk> die from earlier than <unk> .
what is that ?
people assume that 's what to do substances to do .
uh-uh , `` uh-uh , that 's very simple .
if you see a <unk> at the window 's plaster `` i get up with <unk> <unk> solution to go .
and what thing happens probably in her , vascular disease .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what are because of alcohol circumstances there <unk> .
so , alcohol , especially <unk> <unk> effect .
a long-term partner , or <unk> family 's about longevity associate .

now think about <unk> .
this did n't want to <unk> nothing to do .


and that even if he says , i gave me <unk> were used .
i can make good at sleep and the sound does n't really nothing like .
not right .
he 's still more <unk> in blood and that 's bad .
sun would <unk> are for <unk> course .
we know now that <unk> very good metabolic effects that .
especially for it to the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice against <unk> protect .
knew that by our grandmothers , which gives us with <unk> and so on <unk> have .
really not without purpose .
many studies show that dark chocolate and by dementia <unk> work in .
just recently is a beautiful paper <unk> who has shown that <unk> half the board dark chocolate day of the <unk> one <unk> to this level of <unk> can associate .
like that supposed to get rid of coffee there 's the most sober , but thinner .
there are studies that 's going to show you have studies that 's not show .
what 's clear , is that coffee order to diabetes <unk> and works for their metabolic performance better .
and a coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> out how we 're working with guido <unk> from paris to show you could .
<unk> very nice and intricate study in 100,000 people fifteen years ever studied have shown that people that every day <unk> handful of nuts to feed their <unk> about 20 percent down .
this is a tremendous value for <unk> <unk> study .
and this is for almonds . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts the <unk> seen in fact , beans are .
they give just by yourself together to call , okay ?
these are actually beans .
so on peanuts , if it wrong .

avoiding the tape of a lot of the animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only if you between <unk> and <unk> years old are .
<unk> very beautiful new research shows that you , if you in this <unk> overdid the animal protein to go to take your <unk> so much higher than if you a strong that smokers together .
it 's not for the time afterwards , where the animal protein are good and it 's obviously not for faster-growing children or teenagers who grow animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and those that it 'll pick .
generally avoid it <unk> .
whatever they do , be smooth , i knew even friedrich nietzsche that has said of these objections , the <unk> , the joyful suspicion that <unk> are signs of health .
all of unconditional heard in the office .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> who has about after that regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old today .
it comes from my homeland , <unk> from <unk> that 's never get sick today .
and it 's very good .
he 's just did n't <unk> okay 's not an anecdote , but it lives in a <unk> where it certainly plenty of healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed that i you today 've said .
we should all the <unk> experiments <unk> important fact , however n't help .
because that the <unk> of <unk> me there 's not a biological limits but a <unk> it seems to , and so eventually a psychological .
you <unk> the older kids who to and that could one of <unk> mistakes , our culture be .
<unk> wrote the great novel the <unk> a year before his death .
the wright brothers karamazov .
a piece of the contemporary critic of all the adolescent , fresh <unk> .
thank you for listening .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going .

the output 's very low .
lower left when i thought .
it has but potentially the reason that they 're not registered , including people going to yourself questions is viewed <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
so , it does n't the case .
i will show loneliness is really what a phenomenon of people as to be alone .
maybe it 's also because that they 're not registered , because the question of fuzzy drawn is .
it feels lonely , or is one lonely ?
you can be lonely feel , without feeling lonely having to be .
and you can lonely be without having the moment the lonely having to feel .
loneliness that had a lot of shame to do .

loneliness is going to shame and shame going into loneliness .
loneliness that takes time .
and therefore we will now here 's absolutely no station , in the few seconds , when i 've given to this .
loneliness to have <unk> .
loneliness to have the time to navigate their own , even aware of this .
and loneliness is also need to practice to talk about to do .
and this exercise , own we website not .
we have neither the language , we signal for ourselves to recognize when we are lonely ?
there 's going to loneliness is two <unk> , when i 've always been faced was .
the one part of man says , you is from beginning of lonely .
from birth to death is actually you very lonely .
there are few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
this person is then drift up a lot of <unk> and drive up all day off .
i got no time , is so you <unk> .

so i do n't actually , so i just a piece of big universe .
and there are the great group to -- and i also am the times , just so imagine .
the thinking , okay , today i 'm a lonely and the next day , oh , it depends , but everything connected together .
if we see from loneliness to think falls time we start with the really big loneliness is a little bit .
and loneliness of <unk> of loneliness is the sick as an icu .
but about this <unk> , about this big <unk> <unk> ' today i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , about the everyday <unk> where loneliness that we also in such a theater tend to say .
i want to do n't talk about a burden and <unk> of <unk> .
loneliness is in other to detect when we usually not hard loneliness to establish <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , in the moment of a few photos taken that i show you .
how easy it 's always thought , in other loneliness to detect .
and we all know , whether these people do n't really now there lonely have felt .
but who knows it’s not , a moment in such <unk> event where you think all talking together , just being you think there is something lost in the corner , does anybody to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know safe here all .
maybe some now she actually experienced that .
what you are opposed to do you pull the device out very often , so well , you could take this very closely watching this is <unk> that <unk> on the phone , the escape from <unk> .
clearly making soundwaves visible when you on the display look .
now , what is not to do .
yes , and then there are kind of loneliness to the degree of them , sitting on the loneliness is a <unk> on <unk> stage for hundreds of <unk> face a separate and you to leave the hope that from their text would n't forget .
this is that <unk> that you the outside of seeing .
we are other people 's attach .

and there are in the room guaranteed to people are lonely , because it into some other people to relinquish must be it because of death or defined as a separation .
there 's using it 's nothing that still so many people who have a million people in which they 're connected , around them , they 're feeling lonely .
and there are people who have the relation to himself will find any contact more and they 're so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and <unk> feed her in the analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is a look familiar .
these are people who after they think it <unk> of social contacts .
now this is always be relatively .
they 're not the official number , no <unk> number , when someone made the human contact , when do n't .
we ca n't sit down the old people a .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities of living connection with lots of people on facebook or using twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger today .
you can with hundreds of people to be connected to compute with a single person 's really connected to be .

the two forms of loneliness to be very much each other <unk> .
it 's also because that the analog loneliness is a little <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness is good suitable for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's how to draw that the digital loneliness to the future , you may gain is when the opportunity to connect with , higher up .
i do n't know if you in 20 years that continued to our departure from loneliness is very similar , it 's more loneliness to call it .
or whether you to get a new word there .
but these are also kind of the problems of the successional generation .
close to get bigger than the loneliness is itself is the fear of loneliness and from this fear of loneliness that are people say to do ready .
<unk> , the great <unk> , also a <unk> man has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
where she describes what people do anything to do n't want to be alone .
they build cathedrals , you have live kids who then take another lonely and are alone .
but that <unk> she did n't named after the fear of loneliness to kill , actually spend money .
shop to go .
things in him .

only problem is that it 's very quickly to help me and stops , of those potions for the loneliness .
so we have to keep new things to buy us new <unk> .
i got put that ad for a <unk> panties label seen .

what 's looking at my panties has to do , do n't know , but apparently , working either it .
loneliness is so there is nothing to <unk> to do loneliness is among humans as opposed .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , but the worst is the loneliness to second .
hand on a 's heart , who knows that not ?
in a relationship <unk> or the items or the power of the <unk> to see and moment , terrible alone , to feel dreadful lonely having to feel and the to question , who 's this guy really ?
got me with anything to do ?
a study published saying that look at <unk> women about their 40s , married with kids , feel .
record numbers , because i now do n't know if i got the study , even invented while i 'm so often got about i told you .
but now is too damn it gets at least in studies , mostly care is and the reaction always equal is that people before me are .
that intuitive way totally of course , is almost a <unk> .
loneliness to second is every <unk> and yet we speak not about them .
speaking at very much less about the loneliness that they had sex .
now this has probably one in 1953 .
even when you 're <unk> is actually started to think about what do `` i get here really ?
who is this person in my bed really ?
so is a form of loneliness that is not exactly what to do need to the quality of sexual <unk> .
so does n't have to do need to the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only does n't think about it because we do n't you look .
we talk makes you do n't about them in the workforce .
the workforce is the loneliness is also <unk> than we think .
i stood <unk> on as <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better way , three carrying suit and two carrying <unk> .
the two men have to speak , the two women in <unk> have a conversation .
and in between the state something <unk> , something <unk> with <unk> in the hand of <unk> .
i <unk> , i need them the scene not going to do so you that shape of loneliness that everyone at that time in his career has experienced again <unk> can .
it 's the loneliness of <unk> .
it 's also the loneliness of <unk> .

in <unk> , in <unk> into hotels in which is interchangeable bars that often do n't know who they are , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
now this is a form of loneliness to the world 's not talking about it .
just so it 's also <unk> of loneliness than <unk> to misuse it .
cue is actually insulate .
i have time the <unk> told that he called by a client , who has said , it 's what really appalling happens , you can you do n't imagined .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so he himself to <unk> declassified cables .

and loneliness is not alone is why .
it 's always in relationship with other feelings .
it has beautiful siblings and they have ugly siblings .
the bad siblings , we know all .
fear that weeping , despair , anger and the shame .
but we should also its beautiful boys never forget .
the freedom of the very proud of aspiration that <unk> .
so my <unk> look at the loneliness to .
now , and goes in life as a marsh , calling tide .
let them and let 's not by her drive .
because there are still something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that perhaps from loneliness is taking it 's nothing more sensation .
loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard of loneliness that 's thought i have to me two things change .

i think about it 's been done , since i the loneliness in my life accepted some people come and go on .
just like this is about <unk> of that does .
there too , i 'm able today .
people come and go to get you do n't immediately became the planet , whether it from an encounter a friendship or even a partnership appear before .
inspired as i found my parents highly embarrassing .
they can look at any <unk> by without having someone a conversation begin .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led to perpetuate talking .
inspired as i found that as was embarrassing .
as young adult and i want to be incredibly easy for <unk> this sort of this openness to have .
but first since i myself as of loneliness is busy to do that succeeds by myself at least every once myself too <unk> way up .
you see that one lonely having his name themselves ready to the next your gig .
so much .
yes , very much .
i got here three bills in .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and please ask `` i get them if you just once access room where they appearances , they would take ?
most would be able to <unk> otherwise .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we 're at least of effort to the largest negative impact term .
in health , we do this kind of different .
so let 's the activity with the great effect disappears completely one side and make us for some strategies .
we make us for example of the <unk> and the stands for sports .
big <unk> but huge effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we make us to the <unk> .
the stands for diet .
also very big <unk> but still very big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
and i 'm going forward to tell you at least effort into the biggest <unk> term .
if you look at prevention and health busy , you go to a theme ai n't sit .
and the topic is overweight .
and this topic either overweight was in germany long time , no issue , i was about until the <unk> .
and then joined the number of overweight in germany , a lot of .
and i was wondering what was happening in the <unk> ?
why did this soaring suddenly come up ?
and then i started this research and i 'm also <unk> today .
because it was just in <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> to germany .
and we are over and thicker ?
and i put on watched .
<unk> comes running to germany .
and that obesity is rising .
and in <unk> take the curve , again true to ride up .
so what 's going to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it means .
and we are over and thicker ?
well , then i just one and one <unk> .
because it was obviously it .
sports is thick .
so obviously <unk> ' i 'm not here today to them to say , sports and dick power .
because this is not .
but one now we share bit .
the tide of all new training -- and <unk> did n't lead us to <unk> and get healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and there 's <unk> quite fascinating study from the states .
that want to have the problem with obesity .
and they 've seen in <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to shortly thereafter , see what happened there really ?
and they 've seen that people take in fact , and less fat on but people taking even fewer calories to be but still be in the thicker sheets .
and the very counterintuitive .
and so we have you <unk> called .
we can explain this ?
there must get into the body as a plant ;
we have this <unk> big <unk> .
and on the one side is a <unk> to do we all the <unk> it , who are here is incinerated .
and this is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more <unk> here in giving in our power than us , the other we consume <unk> the energy in power station and it makes bang .
the human body does n't going to bang .
the can use energy to store .
and in some form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens but if we have reduced as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> is the energy then makes it was only one thing to .
the <unk> has become significantly lower .
here 's the brain does n't live longer going .
we 're all around for mobile .
and that 's what happens .
our grandparents are <unk> yet 20 miles a walk to run .
and we come today degree at one to two miles and these are the positive guess .
there are trials , the reports of five -- until <unk> meters .
i <unk> ' strike you do something else <unk> with my friend mike tell you .
give you my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you 'll go degrees ' time ?
mike 's american .
he 's shy , he will not much about it .
and he was at this trial here and sitting now .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike eat fewer and fewer and take all we <unk> , and yet he 's over and thicker sheets .
why ?
because that mike just sitting .
and i 've ever watched as much exercise that mike 's a day , and i 've got another way to counter the back in the purse expertise and at night i 've got back <unk> .
and it had put a thousand steps .

and he came up a thousand steps .
there 's mike came on that day 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes was mike , or was mike .
in these conditions that creates disease by itself .
and mike 's not why did dick , because he too much eating because as long it up over and energy <unk> this is not use it will inevitably they 're getting thicker , and the energy <unk> up .
and first <unk> the energy , as you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , which is not there .
the <unk> , eventually came back into <unk> blood .
and there are active and <unk> quiet and quiet on his <unk> .
so the rapid rise .
so if the energy <unk> the blood , then talk about the doctors of high <unk> and high <unk> .
and this rapid , the <unk> there as <unk> that makes all these little hole in this <unk> .
and a happiness goes , there all the fat doesn’t sit and that <unk> just about these little nasty wounds and we talk about <unk> or atherosclerosis .
and here 's <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it has to the blood around these tight <unk> pots and pumps and we speak of pressure .
and if the blood pressure up on as a <unk> true , it 's left at the body bang .
and if the heart 's it and then we call it <unk> .
and if that in their head happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany dies every second thing about <unk> and stroke .
so , in germany dies every second thing about <unk> .
and mike 's not so sick , because he 's not a sport that drives but because he 's nothing more moved .
and if you this context n't know , looking for you always on the wrong place .
for example of the topic of diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , again diet by amazon entered and come <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , old .
and if each book just as an inch is thick and we would have here <unk> , we would have a 30 feet high tower of current <unk> <unk> .
and i put the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now that 's really matter if you more energy in which is more food as they consume you 'll be thick .
and if you less energy coming up as they consume you 'll be thin .
it 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> books ?
and you can only one thing to .
the need is huge but <unk> is to do n't help .
because what makes failure a diet of a hundred percent ?
because it a diet , and a lifestyle .
what could opt in the things that we are talking about three weeks , and you look at times five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back to our ordinary lifestyle .
what 's left then actually , after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except <unk> and then an <unk> the confidence that we do n't did what we set up .
so you get off now with any new diet , with any new <unk> questions do and they want it in their life , in your lifestyle , sports .
yes or no ?
and if so then <unk> .
and if not let 's got to be .
because if the end of anything out , it 's pure waste .
it 's the habits are going to go to decide whether we get sick or stay healthy .
there are the bad habits that we 're sick do .
and it 's the good behavior of us healthy you do .

if mike comes in the mirror look , then he looks down their daily habits .
and if mike comes in the mirror look and honest with the test pilot , it 's also , where he is on .
if he had more bad habits , as good , then it 's just goes toward the disease in transit .
and if mike in the way to toward health direction of its goals , moving its dreams but then it has n't immediately all his lifestyle .
then we need it just more good behavior as bad .
and a <unk> practices , mike 's also a great example that the person , a pretty weird animal is .
mike 's such as well , moving up completely his life <unk> by any way to the driving lots of an escalator , uses every elevator that uses .
and night , sitting there crying the couches and have to sort of knots back to move from .
so you 'll get it into his <unk> going to the gym where did with an escalator , up what you know , per se , it 's paradox is and then being like so <unk> rat getting back to such a recording <unk> , it into a way back to move from .
and my grandpa have ended up close , so amusing , as you .

who had said , sports is a people who do n't move .
and somehow he also true .
why we have to the night , in our <unk> leisure time of the added everything we 're in the ground forgot to have ?
harsh up we have today about this <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports can make a day .
and about much easier to move back here to find where we you 've lost .
the ground .
and so <unk> `` i get them have to a perspective to invite you .
may also the situation , you drive the night , once more quickly become a grocery store and irritates you know that in front no place , free is .
and that remind you see how to realize they 're hardwired to this <unk> in us is .
we want to the shortest due to go .
we plan our homes , so we the <unk> ways to have .
we plan our whole life that we the <unk> ways , but that brings us do n't know where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so you get off now the <unk> activate and the move back there is think where it 's degree up .
i your menstrual like a happy with the trajectory .
and i 'm the only to keep up and down and up and down to be running and everybody gets out .
but if i mean , for i 'm going <unk> ' i mean the time for me .
then <unk> ' i do this action a that 's just sit there 's .
and if from above the <unk> comes to 30 minutes <unk> , say `` i hurray !
<unk> steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes of translation .
and a <unk> <unk> steps , if you 'll see today , every day <unk> steps more go then it means that you end of day 12 , gram of fat doesn’t in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit established , even <unk> days per year then we talk about four point five pounds of fat .
we are not in our bodies have .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> do it always <unk> .
the americans are going berserk , who do something here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are <unk> `` i get four pounds .
just so you 'll see what happened there with these little increments .
and if that the effect is from this perspective , what you mean , what it happens when they really in the active life started building .
and this <unk> to bring it off now , every day in their life .
once you look at <unk> steps per day have arrived , walk you virtually every <unk> it .
and if you feel and have time in sports and then they do on top .
they then beyond the <unk> also <unk> .
when they 're also even faster and stronger .
but do with your health may not sensitive to the sport .
do with your health may not sensitive to their lust , and of your time .
because the main the main they do this now , every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> ' an active lifestyle <unk> .
and for me it 's just become more than a lifestyle , for me it 's lives that at a clear that decision based on the life and for myself .
and i think , health has n't want to do with what we should do n't have to do .
but health has to do with what we do want .
and so <unk> ' today i just another idea for them .
they decide up here today just only on the best .
and from now you know , how do it .
step by step .
so much .

and bringing themselves as far on the most vulnerable , which at his time just simply inconceivable , unimaginable happened ?
we could have also now ?
that maybe what mit media giants to do ?
and how do we could create a force and confidence in our future , here ?
we start sink down to look at the question what we understand kind of innovation ?
right .
tech innovation fund research and development in fact , our official <unk> the <unk> has the title <unk> the <unk> .
so now , i 'm really .
this is all of great .
and we can use quite proud of being and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of fields are that our technologies around the world are needed that we can be good to go .
that we launched an equally remarkable , unique wealth 've developed .
but what does it with the future from ?
what the challenges that come because when society towards us ?
and who care because there to the major environmental and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> do it seems possible way that mattered to be .
a kind of labor .
so the economy that cares about the environmental challenges , because of entrepreneurs . next big effort with what we get productivity and efficiency increase .
and the the world better do want to find yourself in ngos and together and <unk> and they 're going to do what businesses , mainly nonprofit course , then to the damage the least capitalist 's economy to really .
<unk> <unk> to fix it .
but who says , because that we all this as something separated at need ?
how about because if we did <unk> to <unk> social and cultural dimension more ?
if technological innovation also happen cultural innovation are ?
if economy of innovation also happen social innovation are ?
if we can be out <unk> thinking and doing sent to self-assemble into the solution huge ecological and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different have no knowledge forces <unk> and if we can be out a very different , fair <unk> progress forward ?
because what was that ?
both sides were but what businesses , right ?
can that we ?
and ask yourself going to deal .
obviously did we do n't always a contradiction a profound .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
by muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh awful lot caused by the poverty there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just to the direct <unk> to what the federal <unk> 've done .
and he <unk> as entrepreneurs that must have noted for the <unk> <unk> get .
in the opportunity because when i think a i <unk> ' they 're still with anyone familiar to do .
allow you can i think andré <unk> .
'n very <unk> young guy .
and super educated , has also their ideals saved .
and well , so totally <unk> .
i like the totally happy .
and if you actually see , then i think , `` oh really , and the offspring , because we need to our future do n't worry .
yes , immediately after the study has he then here somewhere started working on our <unk> <unk> champions .
he does , very good .
like that he totally and there 's also very successful .
and yet cord out there are so in him .
so he say , there 's not even more , the way in me out ?
so that the entrepreneurial says he would be in .
giants are written in all <unk> .
and like that it 's .
and he enjoyed for this <unk> .
so the right there 's the <unk> that he was right now recognized .
so not that he asked him in person knows , but sort of <unk> tell him that what .
and there 's in the middle of times t : three n , the knew he does n't .
so even more he was surprised to the him up at <unk> personally was introduced .
for mister <unk> .
and as 'n accomplished entrepreneur , he came up and then there 's the system .
that 's great pleasure disturbed , so with young people to cooperate , there he presents his experience i feel .
and the two , then put up with high-intensity found .
and have always <unk> met .
how about because if we just so in a this conversation of the two times <unk> ?
yes mister <unk> , so what was that repeat exactly .
what 's exactly the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> companies ?
i did n't quite understand .
yes , so , andré then starting but look at the question what 's 'n <unk> companies ?
so name says it -- yes .
conventional markets , established products , established a customer , established structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also quite sure that projections 'll be at where this huge entities <unk> .
and time <unk> <unk> <unk> , even though the really properly be able to meet the weight .
what 's going to actually a <unk> ?
so , andré , you knowing that just so one is about it guarantees n't it 's absolutely not the small copy of a big business .
it 's something else .
it was an entirely different character .
because it took hold anything <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of it 's why is a <unk> a temporary organization that the instrumental in a business model to look , to find to develop the profitable , obviously that , but particularly <unk> is and then they scale , let it .
and you 're certainly understand that 's natural in so <unk> organization is very different very different ways of what 's very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , this is i 've been clear .
but after what we look because essentially ?
so , i jump 'em my next to then gets taken there ai least <unk> <unk> make money right ?
so i got there 's degree , which fits quite well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin who would you do n't recommend it ?
so <unk> .
you 'd like your business success <unk> and after <unk> your life <unk> you .
oh no .
but really <unk> ?
what believe you because if you to start for 30 your <unk> money you exactly what 's not quite your <unk> ?

what happens with your commitment , as i know you ?
and what we go to sink the <unk> on .
so the statistics of <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are few years been subsequently became a lot <unk> financial situation when imagining its great start .

now , money is a power of entrepreneurship <unk> .
and it the foundation all economic <unk> .
but it 's never will be a company .
yes , what is the goal ?
the right ?
so when i feel to find ' i got all learned , so no destination is no way the right .

and when i make it 's not got about that would like i can make a search of which i do n't know what i look like ?
so that makes me n't feel good .
so how do i because there 's deciding , and risk that feeling for me all so you know , and <unk> on .
yes , andré welcome to enterprise .
but i got there may what you .
one thread .
so this is yes <unk> , so almost to secret .
successful <unk> by generation to generation passed .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how we say today ?
<unk> <unk> ' i , <unk> ?
so we say to keep getting <unk> in .
with immediate crises and seizures and seizures sustainable uncertainty .
so help save them .
i <unk> ' , i can you one of devices .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are all ask you put it .
it can you 'll give you notice a the big enterprise variability is good of questions .
we can see the time one after the other to pass , that i may understand better ?
so the first is what i 'm here and what i 'd like this difference ?
yes , andré , there are <unk> what drives you that at you is beyond that 's bigger than you yourself ?
what <unk> you on the world ?
what people have to what if you with you go together ?
what you ready to be ?
what are your inner , maybe it 's unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see ?
because these are also your enterprise <unk> .
and how we have this of learned ?
if you a ship building will then <unk> not the men together bits of work a hot you think of wood to collect it 's to teach them , desire to expand to perpetuate the sea .
yes , well .
so then look i let me the next questions for .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , andré now think you can be your goal really ever conceived .
colorful conceived airline flights in detail , colorful , but i <unk> ' you 're going on a if you <unk> what you do n't want it 's about you are dependent on this .
know you actually the story about the pink elephants ?
when i think there degrees in .
not ?
<unk> .
so , hey up .
reset your time , no turning pink elephants out .
okay ?
it works yet ?
so no turning pink elephants .
the robot ?
no turning pink elephants .
you see ?
so it gets us , if we were so on the focus on what we do n't want .
what 's actually the only way ?
there about <unk> ?
yes , right , reset your menstrual you that you know what you want .


actually what just had occurred to you like but <unk> right ?
i got ta get there have brought .
look even see if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> setting <unk> lord smith .
who ?


i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i is what <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .

oh <unk> <unk> <unk> did n't you <unk> ?
madam as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you up one <unk> adversity plan <unk> <unk> may is right out .
<unk> ago <unk> .
it 's <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and andré the way , here 's like ?
is you what noticed ?
it 's something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower 's .
okay .
so , then we can look at the same time , let 's time where the bear or staying at .
and how to action .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> setting <unk> lord smith .
who ?


i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i is what <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .

and andré , how 's giving you ?
so , i remember , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw got about .
i thought it ca n't think that i was n't be .
and even more shocking , i was diving through my head i went there might be that i really all the time so through the area of course ?
through my life .
and okay , i get out , it does mean totally sense .
you set up there is the immediate <unk> to prevent us to the most of our perception and our <unk> just ignore these issues .
but what 's because now actually wearing ?
what jump 'em , i was and what <unk> `` i get out ?
and so andré to realize your perception and detected something <unk> , to make is <unk> other major entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thank you have to sink the next question .
how could i was supposed to my goal here ?
so , i find that <unk> good question .
it ; ask ' i 'm going to every time , and do somehow not going forward .
yes , andré , there 's <unk> good news for you .
this will get lighter and fall when you may have been known you .

almost automatically .
you wo n't have different than they had a brainstorming is in you going to fix things for you pull .
these are then these famous <unk> that you waking up in the shower you .
and yet <unk> question i recommend that i 'm going on the point they look out of you go around , who you integrate could bet you 're asking for advice could pull out there more input , which were looking at home to get .
and you 've also a great example .

<unk> di <unk> when the n't even knew we have the in his <unk> join in florence .
to lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> politician , the bankers , part of engineers , architect and he <unk> very intense <unk> fostered .
but not in our modern mind , where it ai went , yes , who 's catching on ?
who 's right ?
but rather to be a sudden of these different <unk> things be made the way to any way and one of them alone could come up with them .
well , yes , the next question is what 's one particular forward and i do ?
andré doing it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason , very simple .
instead of a big at planning and management and more focused it always feels just on the next step .
because what do you because in terms of uncertainty also do ?
but the lead this really determined and with all the consequence out .
and if it 's nothing was well , dan look like they wait <unk> different step .
and even if the great , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was it 's not wait <unk> other .
it 's why it as important that you at your what 's clear .
that gives you the national security .
and incidentally , as we 've actually all have learned ?
that while we do n't know , and it 's nobody has said ?
thought unanswerable tells you also <unk> for children .
so , this play , learning that we search and this <unk> playfulness and find it 's also , the enjoyment that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's exactly like this <unk> against the uncertainty , which we will always so anxious power .
yes , thank mister <unk> .
so that sounds , pretty good at .
but i do n't so , with me in the company , i <unk> ' there must be a lot of bosses change that there 's anything happens .
and touch some reason here in germany , there 's always get these general mood .
and i <unk> ' , there ought to the politicians first , to make sure that 's changing .
okay my boy , come up with .
how do this time down the water .
what believe , how many people can you change ?
10 ?
tens of ?
ten million ?
look here down .
if you see ?
right , the .
this is the you change can that you really change can .
or to this by mahatma <unk> , `` to find the transformation that you in the world looking at your own .
think you sure beautiful words and great examples , but how do that virtually work ?
we have just be more 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
i wanted to come up <unk> of crises and if you too small and soaks in something or if you a <unk> feel and they all with you do .
and if you looking at these situations they ask what excites you now despite all ask him . '' you that mindset of you take can physically for yourself powerful to feel .
ask him . '' you back to sink , what you look at <unk> like , about you just <unk> .
and lots and finally , ask him . '' you what you kind of this crisis , or what 's bad happened because you .
so i mean , if you doing already happening is that it 's <unk> off by .
yeah well .
mister <unk> very much .
and believe you really wanted to me that helps to my enterprise way ?
yes .
and realize you , mostly two things .
first time in eight at the clarity of your inner <unk> that we 're going to your enterprise what will .
because it determines your perception .
and second , eight to your inner mindset or herself facing .
because they did <unk> you like the other people do you feel about behavior .
future is always will only if we do our own perceptions of change .
<unk> you look at this ?
yes , i think about two .
thank mister <unk> well then .
all good andré <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our andré ?
nice .
indeed , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now actually looking at this <unk> ?
this is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
clearly .
whereas i particularly the spirit see .

and this is what the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
it 's kind of <unk> .

by robert bosch , over <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin and <unk> or you all the hot .
let 's just those mind soon animating .
and who knows that maybe going to go out of our andré the next leonardo of this time .
you see right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it was so obvious that i 'm going to kids and their future study because finally , they children our future .
instead of which is the view of my students of the time enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in jail .
four years have my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for prisoners , created .
we technically qualify <unk> entrepreneurial , which means you can look after the prison or independently do n't find out of <unk> easier to a cubicle more likely to do they also can hold .

our agenda is much not so easy to understand how the code still wanted to kids do .
and frankly i would have thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is where i work would .
what you believe that 's the critical lack of a factor in childhood comes up with people with which we work ?
we discovered , there are positive examples of the often the male positive models .
and if you think about why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> are often lies the idea that my father had no sensible work has that he drinks , you put drugs food or you put themselves in prison , sitting on .
and when a <unk> young think about what he left his life make you want it may not better idea , like a different life could look because he 's no better models for .
and he <unk> his father moved .
i <unk> ' strike you martin imagine .

be an alcoholic father and made the whole family life of hell .
when he was 12 , is his mother died , and he and his little baby brother had to go home .
there was he 's <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect person .
to the day as being a little baby brother was in a <unk> so roughly <unk> has been that the ground are staying .
there was burned at martin examines the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy go back to .
and by this day he was respect .
and it went ahead .
violence was on from here to his life the same for his father .
how are now at the ones that i just described got to continue ?
after the child out of adolescence are many unemployed or have <unk> .
you know what 's not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> spaces .
and then they 'll someday , with people to jail closed ; that it just like this is that are mindful of the same around the no better models are .
about what you think , think these people together to them to get together in prison for lunch ?
mostly about not much good .
and they become better criminals are in <unk> .
they sell and then drugs on a macro level and planning at the prison where you look for the prison <unk> could .
and that adds up in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
so , in germany , almost all convicted second criminals to prison .
then there but also people in prison , who are truly change our mind .
but also , these people wear a label on your forehead .
and it said <unk> .
and everywhere , where you come , is that your first identity .
if you a cubicle and place , if you an apartment and place if you see new york private build a relationship to show up anywhere you 'll use that identity , with this label faced with them an approach in the society as an infinite hard power .
this is the problem , before we are .
how we try to this problem to solve ?
which one feature you think , bringing lots <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
there are more entrepreneurial skills .
who 's a <unk> built it 's definitely know of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
only when i 'm going to management , let 's a little <unk> , else about ' he 's not in prison landed .
these traits , we hope for something good use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three blocks .
we communicate the basics of entrepreneurship and economics .
any people to write its own business and anybody takes on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then be part of what people even after the custody at the <unk> , the <unk> for that strengthening of their own personal relations and it with a variety of <unk> .
what founding go out of our program it out ?
it 's a wide range , from <unk> the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> of <unk> .
a very high range and to <unk> `` i get them to khalid imagine .
<unk> <unk> talent and the illusion of fast enough money to have it already very early on the trafficking of cocaine seduced .
he had always likes to , businesses to run .
he 's going <unk> first started getting arrested the '50s .
and this prison , it not really amazed .
quite the opposite .
he says themselves are today , he had opened its second life in prison prepared .
<unk> he 's going to the second time , convicted of the '50s .
he took then at a therapy part and then the <unk> .
and there , he met up to be <unk> talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september full-size fired the '50s , then october <unk> its energy agency for <unk> created .
the agency 's neat , he can now of life .
he has been very good <unk> reaches .
he 's now here with me .

again , back to martin , of which i got to start to have told .

and because alcohol , and drugs in '57 at the agenda are used to be cycle very quickly started .
he ran along as d.j . and as a security guard .
twenty years , he did that life .
and they say today that he did with this fabulous lifestyle to be not existing self-esteem <unk> has .
one day injured , it’s someone at a <unk> so hard that he then he convicted of grass .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned how he became more force became more success advice and higher quality could come out of the air to apply or without drugs to consume .
and he was about his or driven so thrilled that he had decided that would like he likes to pass .
and he was part of <unk> be .
this has worked pretty .
he works well since over two years of speech and <unk> our participants across her path towards the freedom , because they know ourselves that if you look really change want , and if you have the right tools with your hand if you get that much more is probable as you often think i want .
the basis of these successes are actually people like this .
people who inspire us to jail come up the external kindly with us to come to our participants in what <unk> , with their own personal plans to help consult .
these are our <unk> that <unk> talks about our lessons about , which is students who <unk> do , <unk> the <unk> performance .
and these are our mentors who our participants straight out of prison u.k .
and of these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our kindly an exercise that <unk> calls .
we glue off into the middle of space a lot of tape our participants are on the one and our <unk> stand on the other side .
and i 'm going to different question .
and the time when someone in space that question when they answered starts to him from the line ago .
and it turns out what we all together , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example , where the differences are , is a question .
i 'm going to a call social focal up , or i had a <unk> what ever in prison was .
there are usually too many of our participants in front of the line and very few of our <unk> .
a question that i want to imagine that we all together , the <unk> ' i want to ask them .
and i urge you that they all going up .
maybe we can put some light up in the audience .
i can see them .
there are all .
well .
so much .
i reset your menstrual you now a matter what if you that question when there right answer -- they make it 's going down before , or stay just stand .
this is sort of our our line that we now move .
i have in my life of illegal things done for which i 'd be punished can think it was not .
if you that question when there right answer a place them yourself .
to count , drunk car with dangers of this .
to count , maybe too small amounts of the marijuana obsessed me for .
to count , it with the seat , not quite if we 're looking for .
okay .
and it 's important also to be any workforce n't always completely accurate claims for .
all right .
most of your seats .
we have a few angel in space .
it 's beautiful , because i 'm happy .
thank you can look at all back down .
so this question , if we are on the events are going to get our <unk> lot to examine .
and thank you will also clear , how fortunate that you might have had .
happiness with your parents , happiness with the environment where they <unk> , with the friends and happiness is that you may not always been caught you have been if you something quick aside the <unk> or even beyond that did .
what 's the result of the work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni come from within <unk> days after their <unk> a cubicle .
this is rapidly as fast .
<unk> percent have to navigate autonomously done .
one third of donor the last year , <unk> .
and our <unk> is about seven percent .
i had said exactly the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany of <unk> percent of the other .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year to taxpayers <unk> dollars .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , calculating what a <unk> of seven percent complete opposite a <unk> of typically <unk> percent of saving means .
when my father and i together the <unk> founded , we 're open stood up from pretty much for quite nuts believed in the '50s .
i witnessed my amazing <unk> in a big companies are discarded .
but i must say , i witnessed in my life has not such a <unk> work done .
we encourage our subjects to taking responsibility .
it holds well , in your life has happened and mainly responsible for taking what to your life to happen .
does n't go to hide , nothing to whitewash .
because it creates a brand-new self-esteem and it gives out toward this back to trust us .
and because it makes me very happy and proudly taking our participants open source of its way to cover .
anticipating i 've got a little video , brought .
roll down .
so i was convicted of two years and eight months , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was prosecuted <unk> against the <unk> to three years and 10 months convicted .
i started from marijuana traded .
so , i judgment of two years ago acquired as dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted for <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> has actually my complete life changed .
and what i was important , is the <unk> , are also being made .
because there was my yes , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , would `` i get close to say , yeah .

i did another angle was discovered i 've been looking forward , watched .
and you go with an entirely altered consciousness and consciousness from prison out .
they have this is it became more <unk> do n't fixed goals and you are taken over again into something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and do n't anymore .
well , the problem is that many no <unk> , if the <unk> .

you know how do anything else .
this <unk> individual coaching , however , what 's all being offered it has moved on me just kind of my thinking about me tell you about other , to deal with the problems , above the deal with the society that has moved on me just as these two weeks all the end .
i 've ever since <unk> of my first woman a divorce .
and since <unk> six months live `` i get back with it together .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i 'm including the point of this <unk> and many things moved got about .
so much got about i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my quitting , would `` i say .
i make 'em just a <unk> to <unk> .
it would actually acknowledge that it 's very , many people are the fact , like my mentors now also about this time or out and actually talk that yes , i do n't know <unk> engagement top of people sustain .
i 'm grateful to be proud of all came up that you so what do .
i 'm grateful to be there yet , certainly in trouble <unk> have and i 'm intensely grateful that i cut of your economic zone .
these include and also all the people who approaches , who did .
i witnessed as was with many people in the events in poetics , and the me over and confirmed have this is good thing to make 'em .
and trying to wind ' i left at doing .
and to say `` thank you .
they come up with us to jail .
now , you have something that we need to .
if you see our participants in what <unk> counseled , whether it as the <unk> to us to get there are under a financial support of .
if you see our agenda in a new <unk> wear like , very <unk> issue .
speaking of them please pick up .
martin sebastian and i have here today .
and delighted to go on the conversation with them .
so much .
<unk> i 've got to <unk> <unk> for <unk> longer-term <unk> in nepal , applied .
in a time in my little bit unhappy was .
you do right things .
look for <unk> promote .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery one .
there are right now really great opportunities for how of dissatisfaction deal for .

anyway , i was <unk> yours unhappy .
with my work and so 'n bit of <unk> .
whereas i here for really <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem , i was <unk> and brought me very precisely conceived as my life in 10 two decades , 30 years look into .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> i found scary .
well , good definition .
and then that i had an adult <unk> crisis .
professionally , as private .
i did n't do i the <unk> gone way ?
do it -- to me just lazy ?
or what if i mean <unk> again a new to throw away ?
and look ' what happens .
what do n't want to wait .
it was as the idea .
i was in the time , free <unk> at a published .
but again <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute quitting .
you <unk> free of the world lives in very good hotels and <unk> the country on a very <unk> way .
<unk> but occasionally , which is very <unk> countries .
developing world where it sure anymore to see and tell you would be about <unk> with villages to remembering <unk> <unk> the , though they do n't have to understand the happiness and joy of broadcast .
just by these images and cliché alive , but a <unk> way too .
now that was for me at some the biggie .
i was the what i doing good enough to .
to use .
moreover , it was a little <unk> of me about a country to to write sentences that i actually do n't really know .
i did some .

to <unk> papers to write this .
and around my vested interest to be breastfeeding .
how you learn states are better understand ?
by their lives .
in the lives , because of you home .
not the hotel .
by himself with the challenges and with the problems of people engaged .
and by using the people working .
certainly did the answer that i 'm going to the question could be .
and i did do .
moreover , i wanted something meaningful to do .
i wanted a contribution .
what do good .
and this sense that has to me , especially in a <unk> still do it increases .
although i was before you often in developing world , nepal 's got me just a particularly touched .
until <unk> , there was one there <unk> <unk> 's not just many orphans , but also really compelling economic and social problems left .
with an annual doubling of <unk> euros nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and counting continue to one of 20 poorest countries the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
nearly one-fifth the population suffer from malnutrition .
forty percent of adults could n't read and write .
all these data associated with lots of personal stories and experiences that i on this journey had made me in a time in the i was willing and open up to change .
in the self starts to change wanted .
and drum to stand for my return of nepal , my decision for sure .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me at the aid .

because they just a defining time .
it 's about a serious bid for <unk> international make any company .
and not at a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> to wait a short time in nepal life and starts to a funding of <unk> chart .
hi ?
it is yet ?
i bid was really serious learning and good .
at least i thought it .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was pretty flat .
and got about course off a very emotional response was writing .
and , very never <unk> .
instead , i got about , and this is very intense feeling down to what good <unk> to make .
i 've used as an engine , to my own company to .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company that basically just that provides what i was researching this .
because the opportunity to run a way , traveling .
the opportunity to a country right speed meet .
i make with the people on site of life and can work .
and it does not something can work , but in selected <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in two words fragment .
so karma , and <unk> .
so having much like to place where one good karma can gather .
where you do good for .

it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use to tourism is a tool for sustainable development .

so <unk> , volunteering and tourism .
because people who inspire us to go do while their <unk> reasonable volunteering .
you pay for their journey , like a different organizers .
but they travel out different .
they 're living in <unk> .
and that <unk> 's not least amount of recovery or as much <unk> but real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
to engage in our participants depending on qualification , and interests in various projects .

because actually just take heavy infrastructure to do .
the second thing we can send sustainable kinds of encouraging .
we can own sustainable projects kickstart and funding .
we pay us so to 100 percent of ourselves .
they did n't want to donate depend .
and that 's just told us to our long-term <unk> engagement of meaning .
are starting with our work <unk> in nepal .

and so after about four years turned back then i have come get married and my husband and i 've also do a team a <unk> question .
we move the <unk> way on ?
or what if we get bigger thinking ?
if we the <unk> still believe ?
when we develop more than social engagement and sustainable to go from now ; d in your wholeness embrace ?
and also the individual <unk> integrate ?
or specialty individual <unk> .
if so then basically a new also a company .
a company that look at companies are charged .
in other <unk> but the same thought like <unk> .
we want it ?
was the next question .
'n new organization ?
sure that you want it .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're going ticking .
because we the same language to talk .
because we all the same dreams were dreaming .
because we the stakes now .
and so we have this year <unk> a sister for that .
<unk> .
and with <unk> we push creative companies in its development and to initiate <unk> the us to have excellent people sustain .
to be part we are the participants , entrepreneur and collaborators from the creative companies with individual 's development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> progression of <unk> deniability .
and <unk> the on the <unk> prepare .
the earth 's at <unk> again .

he shares a in relatively short time on where you stand or where you <unk> .
where you probably remember the unconscious biases that .
where you might seem to bit more flexible , too <unk> in thinking .
and he shares a way , what one pretty neat is .
entering a their strengths against the eyes .
was to the creativity that suddenly there 's a terrific is .
or whether it up with serenity and you went inside of them .
and serenity things giving the n't you can change .
and the power , things to change that you can change .
and you very much change .
already in very recently .
we know that .
one example in .
these are <unk> rose <unk> , lydia and <unk> .
these are five very beautiful women in uganda .
so sad fortunes and with art .
they eventually assemble a beautiful , handcrafted <unk> for years .
and for years , this was nothing .
because they simply no market for had .
because they do n't know how it was the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , what design may be in this question arises .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so this year , a <unk> created .
<unk> <unk> product .
or local people out of poverty court .
well you an income there .
the future of people .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live gone .
and we start with a first <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> of a thousand <unk> of our women .
the sales that gives them not just for a year an income .
but allows us as well , the project in much more attractive to make .
this first <unk> is like social crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who supported me , can this one to purchase a chain make the second is it could , but with us either directly into the project to go .
he can become the women are traveling around and actively <unk> .
long will we 're not only five women a job to give it fifty or a hundred .
and that not in uganda , but in nepal and in other <unk> where we <unk> work .
so , but this <unk> just one cross-section of our integrated cycle of projects .
we work in all the core areas .
in terms <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work within a field just too low is .
what happens with the children when the women working ?
right .
so we have this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre created .

and all this makes more sense , as any one project for yourself .
collaborator we place depending on qualification into the different projects .
the specific ways to have would be only in common piece .
and in closing i want to still is just on a voyage .
and there , i urge you the eyes to close .
reset your menstrual you before you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a <unk> <unk> .
and are satisfied and tired .
you 've just with your <unk> at noon eaten .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in here 's pleasurable to warm .
you <unk> out the window .
and see kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on you have a thin coat <unk> dust .
children were laughing .
and calls for fun your behalf .
you <unk> you see stressed out of you may not only <unk> call .
<unk> .
you do n't know , what time it 's .
but soon are you woke up .
and the <unk> , on the same thing called the kids were walking , <unk> .
the end of the street is a big redwood .
here will you with lydia meet .
in the meadow sitting in a shadow of tree as you probably the new designs of <unk> discuss .
and again you get your hands and feet to talk .
later , but also the other women in .
they smile , you <unk> on .
until you with your computer class <unk> .
under the tree .
in free .
incredible that there yet , the internet goes .
tomorrow <unk> you back with your coach .
it <unk> you .
the exchange is every time valuable .
it 's also good time back in german , to talk .
you 're hearing music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom fiona <unk> the courtyard the pots off .
she sings along the <unk> song .
you 're comfortable and happy .
you can perceive it 's going to do .
each of us the <unk> to hit on something new vulnerable .
or lots of a short time that cube again news to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thanks .
before i 'm going to interest me , if you about tonight that they 're here , anybody stayed 'n house occupied by .
i just do with light not really good , but perhaps want to any sign .
down here just `` i get somebody .
two .
here goes up just `` i get the problem is not , but anyway , down here are just two , that 's nice , we 're just to <unk> .

this is the building .

and so <unk> `` i get here tonight of them .
well , and that might be some of you might say .
what 's left at ?
<unk> 's so many .
but i want it quickly explain .

and you <unk> up in park or how ?
one small sample of questions which were known , friends , colleagues have asked when you have experienced that i 'm part of an initiative to and i <unk> ' to produce something that <unk> name , <unk> am .
everybody would expect that we can smoothly transition in the number of <unk> <unk> had .


but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not even the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see in this is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space that 's private is , and so for many people are n't available there is , <unk> ' i do n't say , but you do n't in public hand , and why not be used to how to public spaces may take advantage .
we were a group of <unk> together in a desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , very sensitive and sustainable , indeed .
and we wanted another <unk> tell you .
we were an interdisciplinary team and that i have now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , zoning socially , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , creation , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
obviously also happen with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspective <unk> and highly enriched up .
and have , which allows us on different skills , but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative in part unconventional solutions in the <unk> that we then ran out , <unk> to realize .


we have to memories and images being asked .

here was it 's important that the process over constructive remains .
we 're an initiative , even have we 're always be outside platform and as <unk> terms .
so , <unk> a mental and emotional occupy and then gradually , to a <unk> .
on the experiences that we 've been made , <unk> ' i tonight is taken .
every city has <unk> places .
the one neighborhood a face there .
in many cases , these however , privatized law and <unk> and get the result of citizens by strangers are places that molecule .
they are the dead places of the city because they 're hiring architects tend not the equivalent of what we in a public space is expected .
so for example that we <unk> have to <unk> have .
these , but also the fact , public , the urban places , neglected , this will often , lying .
initiatives , the places like bring want to be a lot of scarcity of interest already in the infancy .
what 's also with me to do , like here some questions , like some outside the questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places that matter of the city not just a face .
no .
they are the social sites of the city , in our <unk> life places .
so knit , we there are often very first <unk> ties to our neighbors , if we look at random on the way to go shopping together .
and they can increase , if we just a <unk> have tools to sit , and we actually stop when the spaces and hence framing them .
and indeed we 'n longer meet them out .
and try to appear with friends , sometimes .
what 's certainly going to play is a sense of community .

and if i 'm not <unk> , it comes to understand what you think that 's anonymous a city called .
we stood up , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens , consciousness , accountability and engagement for their neighborhood woken up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how to protest in the creation be transformed ?
how to critique of ideas to be transformed ?
protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism against the growing and actually do n't have a comprehensible <unk> a sort of the same places .
imagine now that they sit here , before , you break the newspaper on and reading some of text .
love to empower and citizens , we invite you a we want to share three kinds of options for the redesigning the <unk> imagine that an earlier , carefully representative <unk> designed by .
they ca later on the idea that 's a nuance choose .
and the variation in the most <unk> will timely implemented .
they would go ?
would anybody here have to this event going ?
perhaps not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds the first thing .

they ca <unk> , like this forward , looks .
and as was that sounds the first thing in the first moment .
i try to feed me nonetheless , at an explanation .
in fact , because i think the 'm they ca n't really <unk> or pick it forever , <unk> .
first , because traditional <unk> often too late <unk> .
that means mostly they have no opportunity to do lose your suggestions to make or basically the alternatives to argue , but there are already be <unk> design and they ca <unk> to decide whether you <unk> or <unk> in the urban space plants .
or as a friend who recently said , what color the trashcan of them out for example .
second one explanation about classical <unk> 's rarely about information and vote out .
think about the three <unk> varieties .
we have is what that we want to show and they must then to vote .
frustration and incomprehension are often the following what i also quite understandable to find .
i certainly want any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i really prefer <unk> <unk> route down instead <unk> <unk> had .
it 's also different .
although we on the <unk> the existing <unk> many of conversations that cost has we ultimately valued <unk> experience .
and try and we have empirical its confidence and i 'm going to others <unk> share .
i want to pass on these initiatives , in other projects , but also , especially at the city and to the politics .
because obviously , those who are that these <unk> actually run along and the really responsible for that processes are .
because when really the interest in a full involvement is how it 's how often is predetermined amount of mentions , then we need and then we need to do them new <unk> .
finally , <unk> ' i also gaining them all that you today , sitting here .
in fact , because i <unk> very strongly believe .
i carry it 's important that they all of go , and i want it with our case to encourage the <unk> another opportunity to give .
and i connect to me , they all , because they are the ones who sit down to do them a new <unk> demand them .
so we have to participation of look , to look at the citizens , consciousness , accountability and engagement for their backyards and feel i think of participation and <unk> to reignite ?
first of being willing to the dialogue in field ; it .

what we see in this is a <unk> to which we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all those conversations on ; taking place , so that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills across the skills of citizens are .
the citizens in the field are experts , they 're experts on their neighborhood , you know what you do that <unk> you with a place to each other , what kind of tradition a place is and also what you locally missing .
the <unk> , especially in the city can actually pays for what on <unk> level in the project incorporating them .
the u.s. alone or in a particular case you can then other <unk> be involved in the issues you add that sort of the project mapped specifically , depending on .
it creates a <unk> , where all information for those are available and then the place is fair to it .
by maybe even trace get to be able to an identification of place from happening .
a dialogue in field ; also means that the wishes of a resident in fact taken seriously be .
and it 's also then when someone says , i want a <unk> to the marketplace .
this kind of course , total on , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialogue with all right <unk> , which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> fact , the <unk> fit , but maybe with a different place .
well , it calls from the dialogue out then there .
second thing that are diverse <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels really well , when he was <unk> large group is and can talk .
another name it 's good writing me but the text and then not going <unk> big commitment to talk .
another angle of course , perhaps better or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i tell you want to different <unk> give to different market is fair to be .
we have here for example , the ability just getting out , because being effective at first anyway , what happens .
in the background <unk> small exhibition .
now we have the opportunity had to <unk> to give .
we have the opportunity had to paint .
we have the opportunity had to write .
irrelevant to the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the way of our ideas with face to connect to play ideas to <unk> .
and the way to get outside of <unk> <unk> going to contribute to always been moving .
so , for example of a <unk> happen that can contemplate <unk> <unk> happen .

we even have the whole process in parallel to facebook were traveling and on one of independent blog and while news , timely talk about a <unk> distributed .
our third thing <unk> .
you may recall thing that i said that <unk> often too late in place .
in my <unk> event there 's been three finished planning .

if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going to the second one can leverage discussed is that futures for an area in question is occurring .
<unk> hearing actually also to <unk> itself .
and that if not from the beginning watching is that the <unk> event like , and so look , but on the experiences from the previous scarcity .
what happens now , as citizens share her town to reappropriate abandoned and your city <unk> .
is all through numerous projects in .
i got an example here from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is probably a lot of this stuff .
in new york was just a project -- because it comes to a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're in six weeks <unk> dollars to come together to the funding has been able to make or lots <unk> .
the time has empowered , in august written on politics could n't otherwise , as an idea of their own making .
and the <unk> in new york to which i <unk> ' i do n't to say , because he now in the main <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or an administration .
in fact , the <unk> for the <unk> were pretty sure .

the city of time had said <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , which was for <unk> <unk> have to reach the morning glamorous than <unk> out .
today , the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e , wonderful work and the city of the <unk> that the initiative that are being formed , and other <unk> aid .
elsewhere paint people their own a crosswalk in the street .
in rotterdam , around a <unk> <unk> .
all well as far as you would like now say .
then we make but now just so forth .
but i think this is wrong , the city out of responsibility on .
why ?
one , because they 're going to check for a 's all have or should have .
while their dedicated , whether it citizens of initiatives , or company dealing with the rule on one of them in some form relevant part of focusing on the city against the responsibility of projects , the most of the edge of tuning up .
and the second of course , even though the city of the projects , okay , are other option available .

also our goal was actually a temporary initiative for its recent graduating plan was roughly half a year working on the results and the responsibility to the city will intuit wanted .

you have a negotiation .
so we have the problem is currently the problem that we have stewardship has n't cost could .

in what kind of happening is actually more open .
in order to close to come i am convinced that many projects that by their importance of complexity or make their expense of the city designed to be a chance of happiness approval and of identification with lenses .
if you only time and in dialogue with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of town and citizens .
in each of town and you all that you tonight is sitting here .
if we pays demand and , at the policymakers play the <unk> the citizens were no longer than how annoying to sense , but as <unk> .
it was left .
night out of <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> to be .
we 've been discovered to talk .
so this idea , even <unk> second chance to have , if there in life is n't worked pretty , then just once more <unk> second chance .
we found quite interesting .
and we were actually relatively fast forward to agree that it 's two things have to do n't we 'll see the vietnamese .
this one is adolescence .
so there was also immediate unit has a table once more to school ?
nah .
nah .
school , some of you may recall one of books just out <unk> .
with me is it turns out , but anyway , are the <unk> years ago , but the words lead to immediately went to <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> it together and i just want to come back on it loo .
and then i do n't matter how it on you , but in my exams , would be in the of it with <unk> taken seriously , who sat up beside me .
no idea what 's actually it 's becoming .
they 'll get it , so , my school was n't really nice and after i then my final <unk> behind me had been completely clear , you 'll never leave school .
and what do i 'm going to say , but i look at the year <unk> look back to some of the nicest day , which i spent got about , got about me in schools , spent .
with huge passion and completely voluntary .
how did 's happening ?
how could this happen ?
it just started by looking at that something happens is what i can’t do n't expect could .
i got kids .
so , my wife came up the children .
and why was then , very clear that they [ is that turned around that <unk> to take charge .
to the one day when she said , treasure it 's <unk> .
and now you go down .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i sat there 's basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
i saw this same way out how it back to basically .
and smelly , here 's like how to school and then as smelly , and i <unk> feed me , human standing here has seen real failure is changing .
and when i left the teacher to tell you heard and you know , the kids learn not for school , but to go live there <unk> `` i get me , omg , the sentence got out , i used to do n't <unk> .
what 's what we from school , from this school actually do for a 's life really its have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good learned .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> ever really good need to do ?
and probably know some yet , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what is again yugoslavia .
or <unk> , that capacity in <unk> time as much know this in <unk> , just so i do it down button again <unk> can , till i mean time ?
well , i got the time needed to the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what does a <unk> of one point , one is about whether someone once a good doctor of it ?
if the empathic , and whether the good diagnostic properties have ?
nah .
so , `` uh-uh , for a 's life , not for school that tell you .

this is the time , in the in germany , the <unk> then eventually , completely was introduced .
and wherever it <unk> , like we can now , their origins for .
and when we take the time back to think it was actually so that people then they had no access to know your time .
and there were these four or six years that it 's basically being forced them , to school to go and knowledge to be crammed were these were then actually the only way that had to engage with knowledge and the facts and the information of their time in contact to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket over the largest library of its time .
and middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
so , there has changed changes in the world and there were suddenly humans need that these new machines controlled could .
both were also people need that these machines , wait and repair it could .
and we needed a people that these machines , build stop sign of and these are usually put it .
maybe you realize it already .
this <unk> <unk> that we now in germany in many places have left , has its root in that time .
so , and there might find meaning made .
well , because it was probably really that was , what i in school , since learned got to work at running well , who am running it said , who was there be life .
we do <unk> looked into the future .
let 's the <unk> century , where there is , and we look at the year <unk> on .
this year <unk> was the year there was the first <unk> just close to pop .
i was with my study done , and thought , now is the time , now you are you here independently , the first company .
yes , after some around me so with the internet , <unk> ' i want to <unk> ' i 'm going to pull out .
and some corporations are at us <unk> and got bigger and bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow growth , and some of the organizations are going to us again so in a free-fall <unk> .
you see is always two times in life .
and we had to come back few years , but 30 staff .
so , we had such a wonderful growth and we had so exciting careers on board of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if you <unk> tangible sense of what these people do but i was in the school stopped we had no idea that it so what ever be .
even when i <unk> did was something like the internet n't talk .
and the kids who we now into schooling what 's job is going into 10 , 15 , 20 or 30 years of ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and what we know what data will need to make in those future jobs to provide services to be ?
and if it 's face , there too , the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we degrees ' so in the future looking for who could give me because the <unk> for a saturday there .
there are <unk> <unk> , got about i read .
well , you see , you have no idea .
what 's going out what school for a 's lives learning is driving ?
what are the things that we need to make kids for a 's life being unfit to do ?
and maybe realizing what a glimpse into the diversity of what companies today of employees and place .
this is yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and university come in the company .
and if you look like <unk> classic <unk> look to realize , standing there first place , what , like the expertise .
let 's the fact , so who read , and then so , we 're looking <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and about 12 years in offshore .
this is school , now , and also in the future ca n't afford .
what school and now , actually afford to actually , are the things that always important , which are the so-called <unk> <unk> and i firmly believe that that these <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the future will be .
and you can basically three out teams to summarize .
this is one of companies want to take their employees , the flexible , are flexibility in this is a .
and then i want to , it almost all companies in the company with <unk> thinking .
and then you want to these companies in the company that <unk> are .
so we flexibility <unk> think and predicts all .
starting with the flexibility in .
this is relatively easy to comprehend .
if we see how economies forward to work , how fast , yes , how fast , everything to change .

there needs `` i get in the company that with that shift can deal .
there needs ' i staff who are creative .
there needs `` i get the company , the <unk> are .
this is quite the opposite of what in the factory spewing out for the <unk> century of collaborators at running needed was .
also the second issue at the entrepreneurial think is fairly obvious .
because it comes to the responsibility .
because it comes to people who take responsibility .
first of time and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
whether this now the company is or even when society want to , we humans as the responsibility for that telescope .
and the third thing that predicts who becomes almost the most <unk> .
and if we look at the football <unk> remember , then there 's because the internet in this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal was <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't khalid <unk> , of the <unk> won .
have that the only in common business .
and so somebody , this big innovator our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was n't , who had the iphone have invented , who has not the <unk> invented , who has to itunes n't invented , who has nothing to grow up .
who had a team that made this possible , because just as a team would be able to do what they 've done .
so <unk> school that these three things to convey anything could that about yet <unk> school , where we used for a 's lives learning .
but there 's another <unk> fourth item and it 's me almost more important .
and that learning is itself .
if the only thing we think about the future , certainly can tell is that it rises , then there 's the ability to keep new to learning fun and learning to have this learning to experience is paramount , for us in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
this about ' yet <unk> school that they should learn .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the most of you who have kids who know that 's not just <unk> event is , for you <unk> pay to .
so <unk> event and it was like it 's all the option but not yet from each .
to the point where <unk> get elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i sat there and what do i say , the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> nor the fun part of this event .
less fun it was for me as a parent , if you kind of stress around the topic of homework and learn the whole family life <unk> .
and even less fun , it 's when the child got sick , because at school stress rule .
and finally ended up <unk> or was a peak of <unk> at this school also again so 'n <unk> .
if we 're it has no <unk> , it was rather like a <unk> , so immediately after the last hour and in fact , we were also the single parents who were invited .
and i <unk> ' you now , and i understand the details ideally , after the point was okay , we need to our child there <unk> , that wo n't .
<unk> but are two years , where we guarantee you have , there 's something -- not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we 'd actually the question is our child is broken ?
and we are the only , which there 's how ?
now got me in the last two years , for me in the theme involved a lot of people talking and got started to uh-uh , i got about learned , you 're not alone .
out there are very many , which there is very similar to go and that was in two years , so i sat with <unk> flourmill will bring together we were just about , a new company to have the daytime , we wondered where the journey over it goes , and night , we sat on the bar and wriggling around on private things shared .
and what do i say , he took me almost the same story with his kids did he almost equal to you like us , and we had was fortunate that we our children that means could in school , yeah ?
in berlin has one <unk> <unk> at different schools and we could even <unk> into account .
but can that anyone out there are doing ?
somehow were the good enough to just to our children in safety to launch and this day out there will be as well , how they are .
and after we both far seem that had to school has progressed since we were not really changed we thought , yeah well , we are the first of the point now time soon .
just how do we as <unk> there 's anything to change ?
the good is that we deceive them out .
we 're not alone .
but we did relatively quickly <unk> whole range of amazing people found that something like that would like us , which <unk> school , create the rest of <unk> session will .
it 's not so that only the children and their parents lying under the suffering , what out there tends to happen .
if we look at the teachers to see , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we see how to the number of <unk> in the last decade has changed who has doubled .
it can now be that all my parents doing what’s wrong to do ?
that all children dying , and that even those teachers broken are ?
or it can be that 's a <unk> have that not going to fit , like this <unk> ago <unk> years , who fit just do n't really .
and we have many people found , which there is similar went and we even people found that not have children .
and they have realized that they take responsibility need to the future that they take responsibility need to the future , making their responsibility for what our children and the kids who are going to school , going on the way to be .
and we have to <unk> second point <unk> there are out there <unk> whole range of great initiatives to change the school wanted , and there are there are <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost on every school teacher who actually committed , and slightly change their desks .
and there are even the one or other ones principal member who will also <unk> the first step to go .
and how should we now <unk> help ?
we did n't have no concept that we were going to help you could .
but we can one thing i do , we can go into those schools out and we can in these schools , people of school in mind , so the parents , the teachers and the students , and bring we can have to address in two days <unk> lot to move .
there are so people together , in the past more like each other have worked out and learn in two days , what it is connected to work .
they come with <unk> very particular challenge of them together solutions .
and after two to have these days , then take a new <unk> evolve or the <unk> given for <unk> totally new school as we 've done in berlin to school , just be part of warfare .
or the have some concrete things on bullying problems that you in your school , have evolved .
within two days to each other developed new approaches , the next day , immediately be realized that .
but what the <unk> is what about these two days happens , and that makes it for me then as beautiful those few weekends , which i got about , then also time in schools across the germans to spend , is that energy that it arises when the three things to learn .
if the three things together to experience , namely , you know flexibility <unk> .
so basically <unk> think and when they are as a team that experience .
it 's such a spark that <unk> .
and if we four weeks after such <unk> workshop here at so <unk> school to go back then you know that we 're going to school at large started , to change that there <unk> totally new cultures actually formed .
and this is incredible wicked way .
and i <unk> ' they 'll invite the news about school to think .
i <unk> ' they 'll invite back about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' they mostly also invited to talk about , school , to talk .
talk about what they like but talk about it 's looking at what you do n't like .
they will be surprised how much <unk> you get and how many people do it have seen , but just don’t talk .
let 's let 's every school in germany to <unk> century , right ?
let 's all of the education system change .
and let 's what we 've done together with the people to school day after day down , with your parents , the teachers and to students .
because all together we can do .
thank you .
