when steve lopez , tech columnist for the los angeles times , one day through the streets of the center of los angeles went , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , likable , rough , homeless , the on a violin have played that only two strings had .
many of you are the story of know , because of <unk> paper was later a book that again <unk> was , by robert downey junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> who on <unk> studied and its very promising career tragically early by your paranoid schizophrenia ended up .
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years lived then he was <unk> the streets of <unk> <unk> the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read , or film out looking back to not just the wonderful connected to understand that between these two men are actually formed , but how the music that link to move on helping and how they finally the instrument came when the pun allows is that 's <unk> , nathaniel way of the street to get .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , well two years , from walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of <unk> first and fourth symphony heard and i get behind the stage to me to imagine .
he did n't have a very <unk> and <unk> tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers abandoned it never come into a baseball world series of creating . and if it all , because of <unk> passage of our first violin at last sentence by <unk> fourth symphony .



and in just as a <unk> found itself nathaniel when we with our first class in the walt disney <unk> hall started . he had these mind-boggling flickering in their eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how it does anyone in my sleep , toxins wanted .
i feared , not <unk> , but i feared that i would actually lose that he fed into his states immersed could and that i got its relationship to violin destroy that might be when i started just about <unk> and <unk> and more glamorous forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started -- so easy to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i played , i noticed that in <unk> eyes a <unk> change in front seat .
it was , as if it under the impact an invisible medicine of it said , a chemical response , of the catalyst my game was .
<unk> <unk> anger morphed into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and how by a miracle , he took his violin and started to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me up to them out to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started going on a lot about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that they 're not just an encyclopedic know about music owned , but it with you also a strong personal relationship combined .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i used to just of my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles know .
by music playing and about music interviewed was from this <unk> , confused man that 's still around the streets of los angeles pulled that was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> musician 's gone .
music 's medicine . music is transforming ourselves .
for nathaniel means music involves health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions , using his imagination and creativity in a real transform .
and so <unk> his agonized states .
i realized that much as it 's the nature of art is .
so this is the reason that we music to do : so we something that in us all , deep inside out of our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity in fact that form of .
and the fact that expression hit us all , and moved to inspire and it unites us .
what nathaniel terms , it took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family of musicians that it 's mind that would be a talent to recognize him and <unk> .
and i 'll again with nathaniel music , whether to walt disney <unk> hall , or at <unk> <unk> , because he reminds me why i musicians and i reply .
so much .
bruno giussani : thanks . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play that i <unk> the <unk> stolen to this .
i hope that they excuse me .
so i have in my life , many fish have argued .
i 've only two loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate fling with .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , the best meat , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .

you could be so comfortable with me feel , it to sell it .
i had this beauty is a sense for several months .
one day , i call the head of your business , he said , if i was in an event and recite could about sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
there was a company that to solve was trying to get in this tremendous problem for us chefs 's becoming . how to keep that we fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years ago we have the sea fish out how we forests <unk> beaten up .
it 's hard , the destruction of <unk> .
ninety percent of the big fish , of that we love , creating tuna that <unk> that salmon , this swordfish . they are breaking .
it 's almost nothing left .
so it will probably disney or bad <unk> , <unk> , in our future will be .
many arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , so for tuna . a big disadvantage .
he did a <unk> of 15 at one .
so , 15 pounds <unk> are needed to have a pound <unk> get .
not very strongly .
tastes not very good .
so here was finally one company that , attempted it right to make .
i did they supported .
a day before the event i called the head of <unk> for the company in .
we call him , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` just about the fact , to really have , you are famous for this , so far out in the sea grow , you for the environment is not really polluted . ''
`` that basis , '' he said , `` we are so far out that 's waste from a fish and distributed , is n't focused . ''
and then put it in addition , `` we 're essentially a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to 1 , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one thing ? '' which feeds these you ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and that night i lay in bed , i thought , what hell 's a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don on .
i said , don what for example are sustainable proteins that ? ''
he said , he knows that does n't . he 'll responds .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a proper answers be . until i finally begin with senior biologists <unk> .
we call him as well , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` what for example are sustainable proteins that ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers of skin , <unk> , residue , <unk> and to cook food processing . ''
i said `` what percentage <unk> <unk> 's chicken of ?
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .

there was a long break in the vocals and he said , there are just too much chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me of this fish .
no , not because i have a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
so i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> actually from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish on this conversation about it 's chicken <unk> has .
this point of the fish , that 's another kind of <unk> .
it is romantic sort of the way , where you get , more you put his fish about learning , you the fish the more love .
i saw him first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
one of our journalist had been thinking about this fish in fact .
she gave us to enter reverse-engineering this .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef did <unk> .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste , and after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't know , but this guy is it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he miguel sokoloff .
and no , he 's the fish to cook and he 's not a chef . least it 's the way that , and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it 's near the <unk> of flow <unk> .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on , which basically wetlands have been .
they did this , by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated series of the canals , and they had urged her water from the land out and it out to the river .
now , they could n't do that the work , not economic .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds walk around , what a place , many birds are .
and so , 1982 a spanish company with green bought that land .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of water around .
they have literally to lever thrown away .
instead of the water <unk> they brought the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company which begets environmental destruction is completely subverted .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you have something like never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , of a million miles away , and everything you 're seeing <unk> channels and the density , lush march .
i was there was n't long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? because we were and struggle to us by the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been rolled up to my knees , and miguel , holding in peace one <unk> .
this removes a rare <unk> out .
so i mentioned , he <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of pool that it on the tanzanian giraffe mind .
it turns out that miguel most of his career in <unk> <unk> in africa has spent .
i would think of him to as a <unk> 's becoming .
he said , fish ? i do n't speak to fish .
i 'm an expert in relationship . ''
and then he goes and fall into more hearing about the rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and they get me not going wrong , that was really fascinating , you know that <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i 'd love .
and my head was sick of this <unk> piece factoids for fish that i feel the brink had .
so i asked him over . i said : miguel , how come to your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
what 's the <unk> ? ''
now , he goes on me to tell you know it was such a rapidly aspirate system is that the fish to eat what you in the wild to eat the community .
the ancient vegetable biomass of phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish to baseball .
the system is as good , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
depending upon a farm is a lot of your animal kingdom not feeds ?
after day i went on this site of it is miguel around and i asked him , i said , for a place that 's kind of course it seems to , unlike each farm in which i ever been , `` how to measure of you are succeeding ? ''
the moment , it 's like a <unk> a <unk> does n't got .
and we came around the corner and we provided the <unk> sight of thousands and thousands , pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet that far the eye enough .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look to get their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was very confused .
i said : miguel , <unk> they do n't find your fish ? ''
`` yes , he said .
`` we lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year , on this site 600,000 birds , more than 100 different ways .
it 's going on the largest and one of the main private <unk> across europe , today .
i said : miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing you on a <unk> have want ? ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , we build <unk> , not hard .
this is an organic network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
je pinker 's so the belly down the better fix this . ''
okay , let 's going to revisit . a farm , the animals not a baseball stadiums and a farm that their success on the health of its predators measures .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos covered by <unk> n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the nest maintenance .
every morning they go 240 miles to farm .
and every night fly it comes 240 miles away .
this goes by the <unk> white line the highway <unk> may follow .
seriously .
i had a journey of penguins forward , so i went miguel on .
i said : miguel , they go 240 miles to the farm and they go up 240 miles back at night ?
they do for kids ? ''
he looked at me as if i just a song from the whitney houston quoted .
he said `` no . they do this because the food is better . ''
i have n't the skin of my beloved of a fish mentioned , the most delicious , and i may not <unk> . i do n't like them <unk> . i might not be crisp .
it is that <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'll get almost no way .
and yet , when i them in this restaurant in <unk> tried to have it has nothing to <unk> <unk> .
she liked sweet and in , as if you a half bites by the ocean would take .
i mentioned the opposite miguel , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a word .
she 's the last defenses , until something in the body happens .
it has progressed throughout the evolution has decided to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then put it in addition , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm that your fish do n't baseball . a farm that their success measuring the success of its predators .
and then i recognized when he says , a farm that had no <unk> , <unk> he powerful , because the water , it through this farm flows comes from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , of all the things with it leads , of those rivers , now tend to take to lead , chemical pollutants , runoff from <unk> .
and if it spreads by the system , fought , and this leaves is the waters clean up , how it <unk> is .
the system is as good , it cleans water .
so not just a farm , the animals that , it feeds , not just a farm that their success on the health of its predators measures , but a farm that literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i carry it , and that they should be doing , because these <unk> what romantic , whatever 's also telling .
you might argue that you a recipe is for the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what do we need is a radical new conception of agriculture , from one , in the foods really good taste .
but for many people 's a little bit more radical .
we 're not a realist novel , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say , the things have to leave the future of good food assure everybody 's somebody somewhere and say `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
please meet be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not because we have many calories are producing to the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- because <unk> disparities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years of defined by .
feed the grain of the herbivores to <unk> of <unk> , chemicals on the earth , grilled chicken at the fishes , and all the time has to agribusiness just wondered : `` if we more people less feed , how awful it will be ? ''
it was the <unk> . it was the place . it was the <unk> the american agriculture .
we should call them , what it 's a craft in <unk> , a craft that 's very organic capital eats , the fact , the production from happening .
this is not a craft , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> is today face , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not tainted with chainsaws , but with forests , and not across boats , and nets , but with fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we feed itself ?
or better , how do we conditions do that every community , enabling to herself to feed ?
in order to do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are getting <unk> and it has never really good for food produced .
we go instead of the green model of .
this is that in two billion years , employment <unk> .
look miguel , farmers how miguel ,
businesses , which is n't worlds for themselves are , factories that restore instead <unk> , factories , the <unk> growing evidence and just hard to farmers that not just emitters , but are experts on relationships ,
because they are ones that 's expert in the taste of us .
and if i really honestly 'm sure you 're a better , chef than i ever be with me .
you know that 's my right , because if that the future of good food is , it is delicious be .
thanks .
if i give you about one thing they perceive want it is that the totality of data that we consume that 's bigger than the sum of the parts and instead of bringing to <unk> to think i want that you think about how we information that can use that pattern appear and we have these trends could recognize that otherwise , not visible held together .
so what we see here 's a typical <unk> to age arranged .
the program that i 'm running here is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i 'm going to <unk> can do is that i do you have a certain death filter to say accident .
and instantly i see another pattern , which gives us .
in fact , because in <unk> here that people on the most are and they over here at <unk> are .
we can step further , going out and sort of the data , then again and see that <unk> and cancer the usual suspects , but not for everyone .

and who <unk> see that this is especially in men true .
you see so that the reputation of information and data in this sort of swimming in a living <unk> mind .
and if we 're concerned this <unk> can do why not for the content matters ?

it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
you can do n't like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
they could directly to a certain copy jump .
now if i look over here , i see the athlete that in this issue that appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , i click this way that criminalize me all expenses show you have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , if i just a <unk> track get me , i might think `` ok , what if i come up with the subject i 'm cycling societies ? ''
so i step back and <unk> of view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and you get an idea of that if you like this information scans , specifically , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , looking at it or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually slightly different is .
it 's something between and we think it changes the way and what information can be used .
i 'd like this idea now a little more to do with about what a little crazy is .
what we 'll give you 've done is , we have any one <unk> plate and it on a little summary , reduced .
the summary , contains a quick view and a symbol of the domain of which you come .

but even in unconstrained view helps us a lot of things .

i 'll discuss this topic <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> `` elected , i know that the <unk> looking at the most likely to be repaid in time <unk> `` people the year is .
this is really important , because it had a realization that 's not in a single <unk> is .
this is just to see if you step back and the whole issue .

now if i all these people think i know that the majority of <unk> are . some come from science . some , less again , come from the economy . here 's my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono 's a ted prize winner .
so we can now i jumped , and look for everyone at ted prize winner throw away .
you see , we are surfing on the web the first time it may actually have a net , is not just by side to page , but more abstract .
and so let me show what else to show what a little surprise to be .
i show here just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i like it 's not a browser call ; it 's really have any browser , but you can websites to look -- and we make these <unk> to each individual site like this .
so i can step back -- and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
this is so important because you just by the look at websites are in that way , all the <unk> in the same way they could actually .
so i can in my trajectory zoom in a specific <unk> .
here is the state of all of this demonstration , which i so far 've given .
and i can sort everything that today i 've looked at various times , again <unk> .
and when i go back step away and everything to look , i can see my trajectory in new order maybe for my <unk> . here , i decided to <unk> ' seek out , here , bing ; you here to live labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the end to go and they will inflict that .
it 's a metaphor that keeps it 's used , and every time it does this picture bigger than the sum of <unk> .
now , in this world , we think that data is a curse those are .
we 're talking about curse of <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation to turn could and the internet on the upside down , so that we instead of getting from going to another to go to start by many things too many things go to do , and as a pattern that otherwise , unseen stayed with were ?
if we do that can , it becomes this exceeds <unk> , maybe a new source self-driving information .
and , instead of just in information to move to do we know what i get .
and if we know about , then we can maybe their wisdom and try and move .
so i hear on , very much .
i grew with a <unk> helping science fiction to .
in my school i went to the bus an education , every day an hour route .

these curious turns out at that i always , when i 'm not at school , through the forests <unk> , and went `` samples , they 've collected , frogs and snakes and he heads and <unk> , all of bringing it home and under the microscope kind .
i was completely <unk> , you know .


jacques cousteau came to our living rooms with his amazing event that we animals and places and a world of wonders they showed that we 'd never had can imagine .
so that there goes very good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i became artists .
i could draw . i could paint .

that we had opened all . if we as kids a book read , we took the description of the author and projected you look at the screen in our minds .
my response was the drawing and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts , and so what .

the creativity has to wait quite come out .
and what happened is something interesting . what i 'm going to jacques <unk> shows that fascinated that was the idea of us completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly going out , i never an alien world with a spacecraft that point . this seemed very likely .
but there was a world that i actually enter that could be here on earth , and she was also fascinating and exotic as all the what i always imagined was when i found those books had read .
so i decided when i was 15 to bounce back to be .
the only problem here was that i 'm going to a small village in canada lived , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean from .

i <unk> my father , until he finally one <unk> in <unk> , new york , down 've done , right on the other side of border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> middle of the winter winds in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real creatures , i got only two years later to face where we had to california moved .
since , in the 40 years , the meantime <unk> are , i spent about three thousand hours , underwater spent . 500 hours at them <unk> .
and i learned that the world the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich with <unk> life is how we really hard can imagine .
to imagination of nature knows , no borders , naturally as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
guilty to days i am deepest awe of what i look at my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean , holding on a lot of the same intensity as <unk> and the time .
and when i then grown a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
it seemed the best way of my inner drive , of stories , with my need to reconcile to create , to unite .
as a child drew me constantly <unk> and so .
so these films in the way to the images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
clearly were the stories that i <unk> , from <unk> `` not terminator , '' `` aliens , `` <unk> . ''
of the `` <unk> '' i could my penchant for the <unk> and that come with <unk> together .
so essentially locked up , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened to `` <unk> '' : for a <unk> problem in this video to solve -- and that we had such a kind of liquid <unk> create -- that we took on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what it was that was the first <unk> <unk> that 's ever in a film to see it was .

according to arthur clarke 's law 's traditionally <unk> technology and magic is not from one of different .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found is terribly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , this must have done in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went into the terminator or two , '' my next movie , even more on .
with <unk> created we visited the guy from liquid metal . the success was completely off , like this effect basic dignity .
and it worked . again , we had something magic created . and the effect in the audience was consumed . but we embarked on the film is a bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences anticipate that was a whole new world a lot of a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i started a company , up with my good friend stan winston to the time the best <unk> and <unk> was . they called `` the digital <unk> . ''

we did , and lead us as a while a <unk> .
but the middle of the 1990s we realized that , but that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started worrying about -- too slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` avatar , '' written that the <unk> in activist , visual effects and <unk> effects in a new heights way to understand that with lifelike human , expressive characters , that allows <unk> been produced was . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world ought <unk> be .
but the <unk> put quite back . and people in my company , said that we temporary not been able to be that to make .
so shifted to taking those other film about the big ship , the fall .
the <unk> do i as `` romeo and juliet is on a ship everything else sells . it was a <unk> epic , the amount of a passionate film .
secretly , but i was supposed to the real wreck the titanic <unk> .
why i the film did .
this is the truth . the studio knew that is not .
i draw you believe that by i said , we come to the wreckage . we film at the real wreck .
we 're actually in the <unk> of the film shows .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to settle .
crazy . but that goes back to look again , that your imagination a reality rendering it .

this was no movie , no <unk> , that was really .

and the level there were enormous . we 'd have cameras and light and all sorts of building .
and i noticed at how much of these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
it gets into the capsule , floating in this dark , hostile environment just down , where no hope for saving enough , if you could n't even back does .
and i said , `` wow , that 's also , being in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed by studying the deep .
anyway by the part of those with curiosity and science has to do . it was all . it was exploring , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i can hollywood would n't give you could .

some of some of expeditions i first creature in <unk> seen , and sometimes the things that i never seen before had , sometimes even things that actually , they never seen before had and for the science is the moment when we saw her , still no words had found .

and so i came up a something that particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i want my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood to ice will put them and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we were to the bismarck in 1997 , and they were with <unk> .
we returned to train wreck the titanic back .
we took a little robots that we built were out a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and see the insides of ship to see what was never been done has been .
nobody had ever the insides of sifting explored . you had no resources in favor . so we evolved to build a technology .
well , as i 'm now , on the deck of titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that these <unk> here 's very similar , which i know that once the band performed there 's .
and i am a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm going shopping it 's technically just , but my consciousness is inside the car .
it felt that looks like i physically in the <unk> the titanic here .

this set of this is an exact replica of <unk> of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
they made me this <unk> know that if you have such <unk> avatars and use as your consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence was embarrassed you .
it was really quite profound
and maybe a little bit of perspective on what perhaps in a few decades can happen , if you <unk> has to look at any other things to do , in all sorts <unk> <unk> i got to me as <unk> sun .
after these expeditions we started what we go down and had seen , really appreciate to learn , like this <unk> where we these incredible amazing animals saw ; it 's sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with some sort of chemosynthesis .
it exists not in one of sunlight jeopardized system , how we do .
and so you see animals , the right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , we call that they held together .
the same time that interested in which i also very for <unk> , i 'm going out of <unk> from my childhood .
and so the plane i with people who , for space that interest and with the nasa , about and in <unk> sitting right <unk> planning -- you drive through russia , through the mission that <unk> protocol , branching systems in particular drum and people think that flies off to international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but ultimately , it was point that i <unk> with us in the deepest took .
i took them with and <unk> you access to the world upside down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who get involved in such extreme conditions interesting . i took them to the vents at mit , so they will lay sample , take and instruments , test did , etc .
we turned out documentaries no , anywhere but actually science , specifically , <unk> .
so lock into the circle anywhere from my existence as <unk> , then a kid , and the execution in the reality .
throughout this <unk> i 've learned a lot .
i got a lot of science and learn . but now i think they certainly , a director to get you can lead to a guide to be like a <unk> or anything .
i did n't make a lot of leadership , before i kind of expeditions <unk> .
because at some point i need to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out ? ''
these stinking movies are bringing us no money on .
we play time just the <unk> a . of fame was not a trail .
all think that i was between `` titanic '' and `` avatar . <unk> and i 'd let me some level of nails on one towel the beach tweaked her .
i 've all those movies , the documentaries for a very small audience did .
no fame , no pleasure , no money . how do you just ?
do n't you 're all about the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there are . you do it 's <unk> because , and because of funny connection that occurs when a small group of people a team , it forms .

and in this community , you realize that the main thing that anything is that we 're going to each other , because you a job done , which nobody else can explain .
if you on land back and it says , `` we had to do , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and that all around , the whole technology , and the challenge , the human capability , if you look at sea works , '' then you can see the other just not explain . that 's the police or with soldiers that something together through , you have and know that they never hear somebody can explain .

so when i back to my next movie `` the avatar , '' to turn , i tried to the same leadership apply that is that you his team of respect and up in return of culturally recognized .
it was the dynamics really changed .
i stood there so again with a small team up with unknown <unk> . we turned on , the avatar , '' with a new technique that it previously had never happened .
immensely exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we went for a period of a half years to a real family .
it changed my kind of movies , to do completely .
there were people who said , we would these <unk> do n't really good <unk> and on planets pandora transport .
for me it was more a <unk> kind of my job to do the actual process which are in a result has changed .
what we can sort of all this to finish ?
the lessons we learned ?
i think first place is the curiosity .
it 's the <unk> human feature .
our imagination is a power that even a reality rendering it .
and the aware of your team is important than all <unk> this world .
come to me kid filmmaker , which says , `` give me some advice , as i do that can . ''
and i say `` <unk> do n't even a .
it 'll have others to you . do n't get yourself to bet , not for themselves . but take risks for you . ''
so nasa has managed to <unk> `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in art and while researching to fail an alternative to be , because there , i guarantee it a <unk> .
no significant to project that innovation insisted that was ever done without risk of being addressed .
you must be willing to build those risks on to take .
it 's the idea that i can you want to focus on the way to give you . failure is really an alternative , fear and is no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised maybe something , because my <unk> at the foundations are mainly about vaccines , and seed is to the things that we create and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life for people .
but energy and climate is incredibly important for those people , if we 're even more than anyone else in the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow . it 's too much or good enough to rain . the things will go both change how it their fragile environment , possibly could bear .
that leads to <unk> . this goes into uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a <unk> bad for them .
secondly , the <unk> for you very important .
the fact that if you by one thing the price to reduce that might be <unk> was more energy in nearly on <unk> .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> pushing the industrial revolution in and even in the 20th century , saw a <unk> case in <unk> and so we have refrigerators -- <unk> , we can become modernity materials for manufacture and so many things .
we 're so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the wealthy world .
but if we have the price reduce greenhouse -- let 's take the prize a half -- we make a new boom and this barrier operate at carbon together .
co2 warmed the planet and the equation for carbon is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , owing to <unk> lead and this <unk> has some pretty negative effects . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , and of indirect result that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not able to fit and sort of the whole systems lifetime .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the situation , resulting <unk> and places where most unexpected consequences are , there 's some grapple with , but not too many .
and there are safe obscurity about how terrible those consequences will . but they 're incredibly severe head .
i have the <unk> times say , `` we really have down to near zero to get ?
not enough to the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we are near zero to come into the temperature on rising .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have 3.5 feet tall by truck , the under a $ 3 feet bridge over to . you can then put them up squash it .
so this must walk down , to zero .

what ? about 20 tons . people from the poor countries , less than one .
on average is about five million tons for everyone in the planet .
and somehow we have to change make 're going to zero down .
it 's been decrease up .
all kinds of economic transformations are about it impacts and we have a lot of <unk> rise of reduction and go to a reduction in america to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little multiplication -- you have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that it towards zero to want and that by the number of people around , of the service that every man on average , uses the average depth of energy for any service and to carbon that per unit <unk> will .
let 's so every single factor of individually and look at think we how we 're going to zero to get .
probably have a those numbers very close to zero from .
now this is the basic algebra , but we go about it through .
first we the population .
now live 6.8 billion people ,
and it is happening at 9 billion to this , which is at 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> are we could do n't think about 10 percent to 15 percent down , but right now we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second thing is the services , that we use .
that includes all , the food that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> means , those services , almost any of the planet open to .
it 's great that this number drops .

here 's a very basic service . there 's home with light to have the homework can read ?
and these students did n't know , so they go out and reading your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , i finally good news .
we have something that 's not over time ,
because of different successes in <unk> , from other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there are many services -- which is pretty some of those services for letting go down 90 percent decrease .
in other service , like the manufacture of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement very much lower .
there , if we optimistic is , we have perhaps a reduced to a factor three or maybe for a factor of six .
but with the first three factors , we 're going to form of 26 billion dollars on it might <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that comes to be out !
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a key to be -- this is the amount of co2 as per unit <unk> will .
it turns out the question , if you 're going to zero get .
if you coal burn : no .
if you gas burn : no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables and rocketry that .
so what we on a global level need to do is a new system to make .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders of a feature , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
people here have to the creation of a lot of the miracle that contributed .
normally do n't a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain date needs .
normally think there is you basically just wrong and some come out and not .
in this case , we need but floor give and a miracle in very long time .
now , i wondered how should i really <unk> ?
there a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the worst idea of people here passionate ?
i remembered looking at last year , when i mosquitos , bringing in and somehow i liked the people it .
the idea was for you really accessible , you know that there have the people who speaks to mosquitos life .
for energy i noticed this one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment that would be here .
here are so some natural fireflies .
it has told me that it does n't bite . actually you will probably not even the glass leave .
now , there are all sorts <unk> like this , but they bring everybody 's not much .
we need to find solutions , either one or any number of a tremendous of scale and how incredible dependability . there and so for many ways , where people seem to look , i see just five that these huge demand do .
i tides , <unk> , merger and use biofuels , playful .
this afford to maybe some moderates piece , and if you better to do when i expect to be well , but my statement is that we look at all those five to work , and we ca n't of them up because they were approached it , because all have significant problems .
we look at first of the burning fossil fuels , start burning of either coal or gas .
what you tend to make it seems maybe just , but this is n't know . you 'd all the co2 that after the burning of the <unk> comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then go somewhere in storage and hope that there 's left .
there are some piloted 're going on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it to 100 percent to get it 's very difficult to be . and this unification work for <unk> of co2 to produce , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is that <unk> .
who will make sure ?
who can be not guarantee , which literally a billion times bigger than any kind of waste of the second , you kind of <unk> and other things can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough <unk> .
next , rocketry that .
which has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question for certainty that you really feel that nothing wrong can go , despite the human and abilities that the fuel not for weapons have been used .
and what makes you 're going to the garbage ?
because although archie does n't 's very large , there a lot of concerns .
so three very thorny problems that might even soluble , and where you so my work should .
the last three of five i 've summarized .
there are those renewables , how they often be called .
they also have -- although it 's great that they make any fuel needs -- you have some downsides .
one is the <unk> that these technologies create dramatic less than the of <unk> .


the sun shines not all day , it seems to choose not every day and just blows with the wind carries no time .
so we need to get rid of these various sources that 's dependent on , a way , the energy in times when they did n't is available , the elevator .
there are so big <unk> . there are challenges of transmission . if we already saying that the power outside the country is , you do n't just the technology , they do need to the risk around that the energy from where different heritage .
and there are the <unk> .
and about dimension to show , i 've all kinds of batteries , which will be made , looking at the to cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and i did with the amount of electronic energy , which the world 's using , compared . i found that all my batteries , which now we produce , less than 10 minutes of <unk> camps now .
we need so here a breakthrough , something that around a factor 100 better , it 's when the approaches , right now .
this is not impossible , but it 's not easy .
this happens when you try and this <unk> sources of what would say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the world to bring .
if you hear about 100 percent to support of people , they need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what 's the right approach ?
one of manhattan project ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies who work . hundreds .
in each of these five areas where we need least 100 people .
so thank you 'll say , who are crazy ! it 's good .
i think there in the ted community are many of activities , there are engaged .
bill big has several different companies , including a name of <unk> the great <unk> has .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of business were great things to make and interesting ways , and i 'm going to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay a company that , may surprise , the nuclear way around .


this <unk> means that you rather than one part of <unk> , the one percent of the <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent of burning , the <unk> .
this is a little bit crazy idea .
but actually did you have already been thinking , but you could never reasonable simulate that it would work , but since it modern supercomputer to have to do you simulate fog and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent is burning , is the <unk> very much better .
actually burning you the junk , and you can even the waste of today reactors operate as <unk> use .
instead of about the head to break they burn it easy . a great thing .
this uranium is called incremental consumption , a bit like a candle .
you see that it kind of a column , is often than `` <unk> wave of reactors , they 've described .
that solves really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part of today , burn it , <unk> so it says <unk> uranium .
the boxes the u.s. for hundreds of years on .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get plenty of fuel for the rest of the lifetimes of planet .
you know , there are still having many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
and think we , how to our success rate about .
what should we had a testament to be ?
now , we go up to target that we need to reach and then we talk about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's really important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement known to clean his .
so to 80 percent get to have to the <unk> , including countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note she says , whether we have the <unk> technology to use , if you see in all the developed countries used is and we on the way , you to the rest of the elevator .
that 's great deal .
this is one key that <unk> .
and let 's where it back , what should do is 2020 testament to be ?
it should come back the two elements of contain .
we should the <unk> , use to reduce the way to gain , less money we <unk> , the lower left is the <unk> be , and also the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things we companies that not completely to the big <unk> lead , just right , or even slightly less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for this breakthroughs itself .
this breakthroughs , we need to floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great of books on the subject .

and you are actually going through and create a framework where this wide talk to it , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's something that come together to .
this is a request .
a very <unk> wish that we this technology to invent .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years to allow that i could the president to choose , a vaccine for years and i love , or i could this desire to choose who is , <unk> <unk> without adding co2 being reinvented . this wish i would take me .
this has the biggest impact .

what we have so i do ?
for which measures <unk> me ?
we have for more funding to use .
if countries in places like <unk> make , they should not only about carbon to talk .
they should those <unk> talking and they were shocked by the ridiculous , low funds , who is that cutting-edge approaches to spend more .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> creates .
we need to spread the message .
we 've taken off dialogue rational and <unk> lead and also the things that from the government be done .
it 's an important wish , but i think we can see him meet .
so much .
so much .
thanks . thanks !
so much . just about <unk> to understand them -- first place , you can take an idea of scale that investment that matter ?
bill gates : to the simulation in a supercomputer to conduct , all great scientist to get what we did we need to just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian reactor was tested have to ensure that it properly works , one is just in the <unk> million .
the tough to step is the building of the first <unk> , another billion to find that <unk> and the scene of actually the first of building .
once the first is finished , when he that 's as i promised , it 's clearly , because the economics , the <unk> is such as opposed to rocketry that we know them .
and around the right to understand : that means creating deeply into the ground in making little bit like a vertical pillar of nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting the process up and working out further down ?
bg : yeah . now you have the reactor ever again <unk> , so there are many people and lots of monitoring that go wrong thing ? this thing where you get it opens and stuff come and cause . that 's not good .
but if you very cheap fuel , you can kind of 60 years <unk> -- think about a column , they bury them , without all the <unk> .
and it sits there and burns : 60 years and then it 's done .
a <unk> who are a solution for the garbage is offering .
bg : yeah . so what with junk that happens : you can see him sitting in real time -- there are much less junk shot with this method -- then take them , and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by the junk take that has already exists , the rule in <unk> or <unk> of reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so this is what these reactors run a problem was , what we in our fill and so that will <unk> dramatically reduce in that process .
but while you with multiple people that world of these opportunities 've talked about ,
what 's the main interest , so what actually implement ?
bg : so we 've never existed on a place organized and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there are passion and people of business were in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the energy met and talked about how this to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the way home .
this is a nuance of thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have this building , that is anyone who 's a whirlwind reactor was implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and more likely to this really into life to call ?
bg : so we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that we 're very affordable , we secured 20 years to create and then 20 years to use .
this is like the deadline , giving us the <unk> has illustrated that we <unk> need .
and , you know , <unk> , if all well is , and this is a big wish , this could easily , often .
and luckily , today , dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of the , likewise , when their new approaches worked , the funding for its operator to work , for <unk> can .
and it was best when it 's several create , because then you could a mixture use .
anyway , we need a solution .
what the large variety of breakthroughs , that 's biggest thing that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it would n't even without the <unk> been , but the power that there are so much more .
the nuclear sector has some innovative companies .
you know , we know their work not just about this , but there are modular way that 's a different approach .

and so there are different , but the beauty is that a <unk> a million times as much energy , like a , say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can deal and they are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in our own league .
if it does n't , what ?
we have <unk> come to try to the temperature robust to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation , does it 's like when you ate too much , and shortly before a <unk> you can . what makes you have happened ? you know , maybe a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> who <unk> calls that concern with various techniques trying to the warming to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer having to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you pray that we do n't need .
some people say , you should not only on the insurance work because one that may be lazy , makes you can continue to eat , because you know that one of the <unk> save it .
i do n't know if this smart , if you look at the importance of this problem looking at leads , but there are now of the social discourse in <unk> about whether it available to have , if the things faster come , or this innovation longer need to when we expect .
<unk> : you have one or two lines for the to you might have to convince them ?
bg : well , it’s real life , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
those of the underpinning the case , are very little .
they say that there are negative effect is that with the clouds to do , things are shifting ?
there are very , very few things that make it can say , which have an opportunity in a million there .
this <unk> here 's kind of -- with aids .
you make the mistake now , and you work pays very much later .
and so is the idea , now , if you all kinds <unk> is struggling to something to invest , one of you will actually what happened -- and there 's that the investment not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst possibility and there are people in the wealthy world , on the ipcc and look at say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty us should worry .
but my dream is that , if you economic can do , and , at the carbon over , then also say the skeptics , `` okay , there are interested in i do n't know it was no carbon <unk> , i wish to be close that it 's doing , but i 'm going to accept that because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you all this time and energy use of the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals to suffer , the <unk> who confront of malaria and so on that it 's a stupid waste of resources , is money to invest , as it better give things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending to research -- let 's the u.s. government should be 10 billion per year to spend when they do today -- that 's not quite dramatic .
one thing the other things do n't hurt .
you come up to big <unk> , and here we can bring sensible people disagree about when you have something that was not economic benefits , and you 're trying to fund . for me that 's happening here lot of the waste .
unless there , it 's very shortly before a <unk> and funded the only the <unk> . i think we need more things are trying to the potential , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> that you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich stay .
i mean , all of us here could five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research to stop being discussed earlier ? ''
he 's still , for his previous stories , with <unk> associated , but he understood that 's a very lonely group is and so he will now this <unk> .

the research , it 's just nuts , how little the aid becomes .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope that your desire to pass it . thank you very much .
bg : thanks .
a few years , at ted , apropos of peter <unk> a <unk> called the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is pretty straightforward . <unk> have to achieve <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow building .
the marshmallow got up on this .
and when there really just seems , it 's actually really though it because people are staring us very quickly to cooperate .
and so i thought that it 's an interesting idea is that i and it into a <unk> turns .
it was a huge success .
i 've been estimated 70 workshops world 's done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there is some of this task , what deep impressions in nature of collaboration enabled and i want some share with you .
usually they start the most people themselves in the job to orient .
they 're talking about , you think , how it 's look , they wrestle for power ,
then they invest a little time in planning and organization . you drawing , putting <unk> out .

and finally , shortly before they do n't go to have more to lose somebody a marshmallow and they put him gently into the top , do n't just step back and `` <unk> '' ! admire their work .
what but then , almost always , happens is that the `` <unk> '' to a <unk> '' is , because it knows the marshmallow does that the whole thing actually curls and <unk> .
there 's a series of people are much more `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and among the worst , fresh <unk> .
you lie , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
so obviously there also teams who are much more `` <unk> '' <unk> , and dropping below the best , fresh alumni of <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
how our loved peter told they produce more than the highest towers , but the interesting structures of all .
what you may be wondering is , what is that ? why ? what about whom ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of children spent time in the head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they spend any time in <unk> .
there are but yet another reason .
and that is that <unk> trained that were the a real plan to find , ok !
it and then one realized .
then what happens when you the marshmallow for the top grab , you have no time and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently is that it with the marshmallow is beginning and prototypes to create a successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on top , so that they many times have an opportunity <unk> prototypes to fix it .
constructionists see this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get their immediate feedback , what works , what does n't .
so is the performance , using prototypes to work , a lot -- but let 's a sudden , how other teams of them live .
the average for most 's around about . <unk> , <unk> create the half of lawyers bit better , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architect and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the ultimate thing i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles and understand <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build systems to build .
ceos are about average , but here it gets interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator at the team , they become significantly more .
it 's unbelievable . you see around and see , `` this team will win . ''
you can predict . why does this ?
because they 're special faculties the <unk> have .
they pour the process , you understand him .

<unk> skills and <unk> and combined , lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical approach to get you ca : sixth need to build systems have .
i tried to see something very exciting .
i thought , we enter the <unk> same .
so drastically , i a <unk> dollar prize to software for the winner .
what you believe that happened with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
so this happened . not a team had to build a structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high construction built had , he would have the paycheck home and worn away .
so it 's not interesting that high <unk> a powerful effects of ?
we reenacted this exercise with the same school students .
what you believe that happened now ?
well understood the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , bad team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the slightest time .
there 's sort of the <unk> lessons for us , about nature of panic and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually time to invest a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i <unk> digital tools and processes to create to teams to help , cars , games or `` <unk> <unk> '' to create .
and what the <unk> do is , it helps them hiding by accepting to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is offering a shared experience , a common language , or ethos , the right prototype in making .
and this is the value of the experience , this as easy to practice .
and those of them out there are interested , can <unk> park .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow building .
there 's a <unk> there .
they 're crazy examples from all around how people the system telescope and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that structure actually a <unk> sports is .
it requires that we all our senses at the task to fix them , that our thinking optimal , pharmacological drugs like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us about .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype of the experience anything that 's needed to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a <unk> '' moment to bring .
and it is a big difference do .
so much .
we do such as if we 've got a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a certain .
and everybody in this room has to skeletal muscle .
and you can go back to go , you can in the future go ; you can not in here and now can stay
and i wonder what they would choose , because i my friends recently , often asked this question , and they wanted everybody in the past go .
i do n't . they wanted to the time ago , before it 's cars were or twitter or `` america in seeking the superstars . ''
i do n't .
i 'm convinced that you kind of nostalgia , to <unk> drawn is .
and that i understand .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and do n't know , because i did the explorers am .
it because data that capability on earth 's not go back , you go ahead .
i want so in this machine , and i want to the future go .

there was never been a time as that .
my <unk> dying every once they got 60 were .
my grandparents urged this number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 miles to hurl .
there was so good as a nine as i started <unk> are .
but it 's not going to people like us , because it is a larger point of this .
a child , today in <unk> 's born can wait long as being like the richest man in the world hundred years ago .
you think about . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox : the smallpox was a billion people on earth 's killed .
they have the demographics of the world in a way of new form , how it 's no war ever done by .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have you <unk> . pfft .
in the wealthy world are diseases , the millions of us from the only one generation also threatened , barely left .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
know about somebody , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that 's both successes of scientific method .
and in my view is the scientific method -- things to try to look at whether it works , it change , when it does n't , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
sadly , it really all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were frequently said ,
and one of which is that despite all our gains in a billion people around the world every day hungry going to sleep .
this number drops , and she gets very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and more than that , we have our ability to be used for this planet properly account for <unk> .
drinking , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , which was soon , and if we do n't feel like this chaos <unk> disappearing , we also .
the question is : we can do ? i do .
i think it 's clear that we eat food can produce , the billion people feed , without the country , on her life , to rape .
i think we can see the world of power , you are not also have wiped out .
i believe that really , and no , that 's no <unk> .
but this keeps me at night awake , one thing that time at night , the wake of living . we have scientific advances are never been desperately to come like now , never ,
and we were also never been able to give a reasonable <unk> , as we of it can .

people husks of living in their faith that , so intimately that you ca n't you remove it .
n't even the truth will they free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his mind , even a right on his view of progress ,
but you know what they 're not that are right ?
they have no right for their own facts . <unk> , it did n't .
and i have a while needed to determine this .
about a decade , i have an article on shots for `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed that in opposition to bump , in opposition to what i ended up effective activity in health in history of humanity 's .
i did n't know what i should do , so i did easy thing i do , i wrote an article and went forth .
and soon i wrote an article on <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were going berserk .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand why the people thought that was `` <unk> , why they believed that molecule increases in a particular place a random part of <unk> a <unk> on the amount of nature was .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote this paper , i went on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we tap , we join a , we eat out that 's okay .
but these articles were worried , and i could n't want to discover why , and i would eventually it out .
and that because data that these <unk> to me nuts were doing does n't <unk> were .
these were <unk> people , educated people you 're decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and i was such total kludge .
but then i thought , you know what , let 's face .
we 're at some point where we 're not the same proportion of progress , as before .
we talk <unk> it .
we talk about it ironic that , with small quotes about `` progress . ''
okay , for that is reasons , and i think we know which causes these are .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science to be lost , and we have no reason you 're not that should be .
you can just a couple of names call and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , <unk> that <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list vote .
there are questioning and problems with people that we believed that they always being right . be so skeptical .
so you ask , costing them evidence , costing them expense receipts .
take nothing for granted .
now they get ready , if you evidence to get you have this evidence to assume , and there are not good .
and i can go from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear life , i do you never seen , and hopefully will never see me .

very scary .
tons of studies were done to see whether that true .
tons of studies should be conducted . that 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in , in the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all together , any correlation , no link , no .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we of anecdotes think we believe what we see what we look at believe what does that we really feel .
we think , not to a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , then i understand that , i think we do all .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating ,

this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it 's horrible .
what happened that we do that could .
now , i understand that . i am .


does n't very often .
this is happening in this country not calling , but 160,000 time in the last year .

but because n't it 's happening is , we can it into denial , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk and sending messages of anxiety and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation should n't fused .
they do n't that these things does seem to be , but almost no equivalent of us .
and this is something that we have to learn about that , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .

not fearful , no distress , <unk> phew , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
he says , paul <unk> .
he 's just with a few other people 's a <unk> developed .
he does the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world would save .
pretty well , right ?
now , which is good , besides that paul is non-carbon-based life and through vaccines are talking and says , how valuable they are , and that people just need to stop to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's a terrorist .
if paul in a public confirmation of thing , he ca n't having fully armed guardians statements .
he 's getting calls home , because people he likes to tell you know where his children to go to school .
and why ? because paul a vaccine has done .
i do n't say that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them on to return the diseases come back , terrible disease , and they 're going on .

and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .

what about <unk> ? take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine took me , a few weeks written and told you think i 'm a little bit more <unk> .
nobody 's ever said earlier .
they would their children not against <unk> immunized . no way .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't <unk> have . and you know what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , no <unk> .
now , i did n't know , maybe he got this morning guy in lagos at a plane and fly straight to los angeles , now , he died of ohio .
and in a few hours , it lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight it has gone .
and he did n't know that he of debilitating illness or infected , and we know that not , because this works the world now time .
this is the planet , which we live . they do n't , as if it does n't it 's .
we love this , to lie to the husks of . we love this .
you have this morning everybody their vitamins to the point ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , and go on the hops helps .
i know that they did , because half the americans that every day power .
you take the stuff , and you take alternative is causing , and it does n't matter how often we find that they are useless are .
the data of evidence from the time .
they darkening them on their urine , more do you almost no .
it 's okay , you want to 70 billion dollars for the dark side of urine numbers .
i agree with them totally open up .
darker the urine , dark .
why do this ? why do this ?
now , i think that i see -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate each one too strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should not . our healthcare is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing and cold <unk> to us that it can afford .
we go so that way , and where do we ?
we walk into the poor of <unk> .
it 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's quite a serious business , because this stuff is poo , and we spend a billion dollars for quieting down .
and i 've all up as props about here .
none of -- <unk> , again , <unk> , again , <unk> , because i do n't even what this is , but we give billion dollars for this , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , scream at the people at and say `` what are paying you ? let the people hold , what they want .
so you feel good . ''
and you know what you have wrong .
because it really matter is whether it 's health is , who is , `` hmm , i 'm the expense of experts getting mammograms have n't suppose '' or any <unk> , of your patients with <unk> treat want .
if you look at this road entering , where do n't think and magic expense receipts of science and replace the movements , you a place where they 're not trying to be .
they go to <unk> <unk> in south africa .

hundreds undue deaths in a country , the worse than any of this disease absolutely will .
tell me , ah , that these things not a consequence out .
they get them . they 're always .
now , the <unk> epidemic in which we face now , is this ridiculous battle between the <unk> <unk> modified foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about how metaphor .
this is an ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , every <unk> , by the people changed .
you know , it was no <unk> in paradise .
it was no <unk> .
it was no trees . we have this all done .
we have it in the last 11,000 years doing .
and some of it 's worked and some of this is not .
we 're <unk> what did n't work .
now we can it in a little bit . so obviously there risks . but we can really the vitamin a lot of rice and do , the stuff can million people to help millions of people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say that i understand not .
we lean <unk> changed the food off .
why do it ?
so what i always listening is , too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't a huge areas in this one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want that companies are living in flight .
we do n't want that companies seeds have .
and you know what my response to all this is ?
yes , they are right . repair it .
it is , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
so it with science nothing to do .
it 's quite fond of morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .

you know , in the next 50 years we will cover 70 percent longer growing food to be the moment . 70 percent .
that investment in africa in the last 30 years .
i 'm ashamed , shameful .
they need this , and we give you get them .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people not to encourage that <unk> stuff to eat , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that a half billion people eat .
it 's sort of a potato .
it 's just a bunch more calories . it 's miserable .
it has no resources , it 's not a protein , and scientists building it all right at a .
and then you might ask people the food and would n't been blind be .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
if so beautiful . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it was pretty .
and everything that i want to say is : why stop it ?
i mean , we wonder : why stop it ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about genes <unk> . it 's not chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous obsession with hormones , our insisting on more food , better food , unprecedented act of food .
it 's not at rice <unk> , it 's about people to stay alive to maintain , and it 's time again , to understand what this .
because you see what ?
if we do n't do if we so on doing as usual do we look at a little bit guilty , where we actually , i think , not guilty about trying to be , high-tech colonialism .
there are no description for what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our n't worthy , and we 've actually stop .
after that really fun entertainment so you want you might say `` will you still in this ridiculous certain and in the future to go ? ''
anyway . and let me , anyway .
now , put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see certain everything to imagine what we want .
we can you <unk> where we do you <unk> want , and we are going to move where we want .
we have these conversations can now , and we need to think , but if we come into a certain up , and in the future will go to be relieved that made for .
i know that we can , and so it my case that 's something that the world needs now .
thanks .
thanks .
for some time interests me for the <unk> . there may be weird stuff that 's a magician . for interest , unless there , they look it like me , as , a deception , which became somewhat true is that if you just for sure enough to believe . ''
in other words , <unk> have in some studies a measurable effect on shown that <unk> , which was just because the person thinks they do with it 's going to be a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there , if the patient to be very tightly enough think a measurable effect on the body of that the <unk> calls .
a conjurer 's going to be true because somebody 's like seeing .
so we find mutually exclusive to understand , i want to go through a fundamental , very simple trick them .
and i 'll show how he works . this is a trick that least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for kids ' .
i , saw him from <unk> scout magic of <unk> in the 1970s learned .
i 'm kind of you do it and i 'll explain .
and then i 'll explain why i would explain .
so , you see what happens .
the knife , that they study how can ; my hand , which you examine this .
i 'm the knife just so in my their living .
i push my sleeve up .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappear and of him out , i 'll just my wrist right here <unk> .
it 's how you can see that 's going to any time at any moving . as i here <unk> , can zip in my sleeve , villages , or paint .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is the knife by my bare physical magnetics watching .
it sits actually so focused on its place that i 'm going to shake up , without having the knife <unk> .
nothing goes into my sleeve , comes out there 's no <unk> . and you can all the senses .
<unk> .
well , this is a trick that i often a little kids <unk> that concern for magic of doing , because you can take lot about deception to learn when you specifically looking , so for a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works .
i keep the knife in my hand .
i say that i my wrist <unk> to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason why i my wrist <unk> , is that at the real secret of illusion is .

wonderful trick ?
back there is someone who 's not a childhood had .
so , he 's here . right .
and if i 'm <unk> , changing the finger in its position .
and now you could talk about , why this is a conjurer 's why you 're seeing that down here just three fingers to see is : because the mind and the way that he information processing , they do n't do individually counts , one , two , three , but it as a group does .
but that 's what now is to do n't actually , and then open my hand .

and when i my hand up close to happen the same time , i make me <unk> , going through this movement , unseen . the first shot up again <unk> .
i assume that hand away . and this is that knife .
this trick , you can your friends and neighbor to demonstrate . thanks .
now , what does it with <unk> to do ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that i 'm really just blew it .
i 'm no doctor or explorers , and so i was going to me an amazing thing .


and that , although almost none of any <unk> -- this is just <unk> .
but a white pills is not just about a blue pill .
what ? that made me really <unk> .
it turns out what turned out that 's not all is .
if you capsules take that are still <unk> as tablets every form .
a colored capsule that look at the end of yellow and across the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
and the <unk> a role .
a pill twice a day is not just about three pills -- i 'm not going to capture the statistics remember . sorry .
the truth is that ...
... that 's also the <unk> a difference .
and the form a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , we need to the needle reach out .

that creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much worse than a white pills .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to another time scale , if you <unk> have .
fact , is that the white pills not as good looks like the blue pill , which is n't just looks like a capsule that not just looks like the needle .
and none of it has some really <unk> property . it 's only our believe that in us a stronger effect chalked up .
i wanted to know if i this idea for a trick could use .
i take something that obviously a conjurer is , and i leave it really look .
we know from the one study that you to the needle access to handle when it 's an enormous amount is about .
this is an 18 feet long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to start with a little bit of sterile .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special cultured meat .
this is my skin . that 's no <unk> from hollywood .
i 'll discuss this needle in my skin stick and through into it drive till you on the side , again <unk> .
if you culprit is -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i did that a few friends last night in the hotel room hand , and some people who i did n't , and what 's a woman who almost fainted from .
so i look : if you realize that the culprit is , look for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm the first <unk> part back here is done .
you can see , you can also <unk> , if you like .
so , it 's so , right here where my ham starts , the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a little <unk> do .
does n't really sorry . she does this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same condition that we look at <unk> had .
about .
but now you can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so i 'll use them show . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what people imagine if you see that .
they say `` okay , who 's probably not so stupid and <unk> himself the skin , just to us a few minutes to speak . ''
now , then i 'm going to show .
what does this looks like ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people back to say `` okay . i do n't actually seen . ''
people in the <unk> get right now in .
let 's me tell you up close to show .
this is really my skin . that 's no <unk> from hollywood .
it 's my ham , and i can <unk> .
sorry . if you culprit is going to take away , look not going .
people back or they 're going to go back sometime at video to see , will say , `` well , can see that 's fairly impressive , but if it really were , he would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really want to be , it would we bleed . ''
okay , let me some blood for you <unk> .
yes , this is it .
usually i would go through the needle elements .
i would my arm spill-cleaning and you show that there 's nothing terrible wounds of us .
but i think , in this scale here and with intent , from a conjurer 's something real , to do i want to the needle is just in there , and so from the stage to go .
we 're in the next days have a few times each other .
i hope you celebrate part of it on . thanks .
everybody talks today about happiness .
i have some people the number of books they count off to get `` <unk> '' in the titles for the last five years or published by introducing and they gave about 40 up , and there was much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest in luck of explorers .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would like to people happy to do .
but despite all of flood of work , there 's several different cognitive fall out there is kind of almost impossible to make sure about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly by these cognitive take action .

the first of the fall is a <unk> , complexity actually acknowledge .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word more is because we 're going on too many different things work .
i think there 's a particular meaning that 's take a hedge could , but in and large that 's something that we give up to be , and we are the complicated perspective i suppose we need for what well-being is .
the second case , a really confuses most of experience and memory , basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we did n't think about a circumstance that can think , the well-being is affected , without its significance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there are just a way , it right -- the elevator .
now i 'd like to an example start by somebody who had a <unk> had a little bit of my lectures , of a story told . [ unclear ... '' he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely splendid music , and very end of recording was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it in addition , really very emotional , which has the whole experience was ruined .
but it did n't .
what it ruins had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience anyway .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music business .
they <unk> not because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that 's going to keep that had received .
what we really saying is that we come over and about other people think we could be in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> self that in the present to live and the present know , is able to the past back to experience , but basically just the present time .
it 's the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know when the doctor says , `` do now it hurt if i told me show <unk> ? ''

or `` what was their journey to albania ? '' whatever .
these are two very different entities that <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and the two to confuse this is part of <unk> of <unk> about happiness .
well , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really a basic reaction to our memories of -- it begins immediately started .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we can do , of stories .
our memory shares stories , which is what we of our experiences keep that allowed is a story .
and let <unk> with an example start .
there are an old one study .
that 's real patients who have a painful procedure scanner .
i 'm not into detail officers hanging out . you today is n't hurt anymore , but she was painful , when that study the 1990s done .
they were asked , all 60 seconds about their pain , and tell .
and there are two patients . 's her records .
and they will say , `` use of both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b is clearly has n't have suffered . his <unk> been longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's another question : how much thought these patients that they have struggled with ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient as a lot <unk> <unk> of the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a really vital part of history is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and that are worse is used to where the pain , really the end up its zenith , it 's a bad history .
how we know that ?
because we these people by their <unk> asked , and so much later , `` how bad news was the whole thing , total of ?
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
now , which is a direct fight between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even have b is a clear <unk> time .
so what you 're using patient is a , could do , and we 've actually clinical experiments , and it 's been , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of patient is a to increase by just the hose in it makes no one of him to bit .
this is going to rediscover that the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and so if you a few minutes has power to internalize that the <unk> themselves from the patient is a worse off , and you have consequences that the <unk> themselves from the patient as much better off this , because now , patient as a better story about his experience history .
what makes a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory we discover magazine and it 's also for the stories that we invent .


well , that <unk> even live life to be delivered continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and you say , what happens with those moments , ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .

most of you are completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet they get kind of the impression that they are supposed to what during these moments of <unk> happens , our lives is .
it 's the finite resource that we use as we 're in the world are .
and how we they consume would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> itself to we keep .
so we have the <unk> self and that <unk> itself , and they are really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the deal with time .
of view of <unk> even if you a holiday , and the second one week , just like this is good as the first , it 's the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that does not calling for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation ridiculously better than the <unk> holiday , because there 's no new memories added up .
they have the story n't changed .
and it 's how is time actually the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . of time , very much impact on this story .
well , that <unk> make it yourself anymore , as to remember and of stories .
it 's actually the one of this was making decisions , because if you a patient , the , say , two <unk> at two different surgeons had and they decide what he chose to , it 's the , the votes of the memory , the less bad , and this is the surgeon who was selected will happen .
this <unk> itself has no voice in the election .
actually choose , we move between those moments , we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we look at the future thinking , we think about our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future for more than <unk> memories .
and basically we can do you look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can see this <unk> even thinking as one that sort of the <unk> even <unk> of experiences that the <unk> do n't need .
i have the impression that if we 're going to travel this very often the case , which means that we go on vacation largely on services of <unk> itself .
and that 's a bit hard to justify that i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we of our memories ?
this is the reason that for the dominance of <unk> itself is given .
and when i think about , i think about a holiday , which we put a few years in antarctica that made , who clearly the best vacation with , i 've ever had , and i think quite often think about the relative to how often i think of other on holidays think .
and i 've probably from my memories of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes in the past four years <unk> .
now if i ever the folder open , and i would be connected with 600 images of course having an unexpected lesson i 'd spent .
now , that 's three weeks , and this , greenwash a half hours .
because it looks like an incongruity , to give .
now , i like a little extreme , you do you know , in how little appetite for me on the <unk> of memories , but even if you more of doing it is a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight that we experiences that matter ?
so i want that they had a <unk> think .
imagine your next vacation ago , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures gutted , and you have a <unk> drug , so that you going to do n't remember being .
now , it 's going to the same vacation choose ?
and if you another vacation would choose , they have a conflict between her two types of self and you must think about how they were viewing this choice and this is really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories think they could have another answer to get .
why we the holidays picking that we choose is a problem that we had to make a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self : drop two words about happiness in .
there are actually two ideas about happiness that we can use , one per second self .
so you can ask : how happy that 's <unk> itself ?
and they would ask : how happy are those moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- happiness in moments , is a fairly complicated process .
which are the emotions that view , can be ?
and , the way , we 're now just look at a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> itself over the time .
if you have the privilege of <unk> even asking it 's a whole other thing .
this is not about how happy one person is alive .
it 's about how fulfilling and enjoying the person 's when they 're about her life system .
very different term .
anyone who these concepts n't distinguish it 's exploration of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being that exploration of happiness long <unk> have on these same way .
the distinction between happiness of <unk> itself and of contentment for <unk> itself is in recent years recognized the '50s , and so anxious you look , the two <unk> to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , the more than half a million people them questions have been about what you about her life thinking about and their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
in recent years , we have begun to do about happiness or the other kinds of self to learn .
and that identifies thing that we think i was , we 've learned is that they really different are .
you can know how to please anybody with his life is , and that teaches you do n't a lot about how excited he live your and vice versa .
just to you a sense of the correlation of bed , the correlation 's about <unk> .
what this is that if you know someone be met and you would say , oh , his father 's a <unk> how much would you about his greatness know ?
well , they were about his greatness know , but there are much uncertainty .
they were so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that someone your life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , they much uncertainty about how excited he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the happiness of <unk> does .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means you very pleased to be with people who we like that time to spend with people who we like .
there are other occupational pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you that happiness or the other kinds of self can maximize want you 'll end very different things .
the implication of what i 've said , is that we 're lucky i do n't introduce you should be a backup to comfort .
it 's a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason , that we no idea of happiness can think is that we 're not going on the same things as if we think about life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question , as happy people in california are they will not the correct response time .
if they ask you think that people in california happy to be if you , say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about life in california , who think you think of the difference between california and elsewhere , and that difference is to say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful self that decide how happy people are .
now , but because the thoughtful and thus responsible is , you can end -- some people might end to california , there .
and it 's sort of interesting to catch what happens to people who to california to move in hopes , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy to be .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier , because if you think about you 'll remember is how awful the weather in ohio , and they 'll feel that they are the right decision about .
it 's very difficult to clear about well-being thinking , and i hope , i have you a sense of it should learn how difficult it 's .
thanks .
thanks . i have a question for them .
so much .
so when we , a few weeks phone 've talked about them towards me that it 's a pretty interesting thing , which had this <unk> survey ever occur .
that 's something where they were participating can climb , because they now a few minutes left of ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most exciting thing that we in <unk> survey ever have found is a number that we absolutely not have been expecting had .
we found that in terms of the privilege of <unk> itself .

and it turns out , under an income of 60,000 per year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a lot of representative sample , under a salary for all over 600,000 dollars a year
60,000 .
dk : 60 .
60,000 per year , people are deeply unhappy , and they become more unhappy , the poorer they will .
and then we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely make flat line seen .
what happens is obvious that money to do n't <unk> 17th , but that lack of money one certainly misery 17th , and we can create the misery truly , very clear to measure .
in terms of other self , of <unk> itself , they get another story .
the more money you earned the more of satisfaction is you .
it 's not in emotions .
but danny , the entire american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people this database take seriously would , i mean , it feels it upside down to ask , everything that we think for example in terms of <unk> and so forth .
there a chance that politicians that land is generally a database of the gravity would take and that 's based upon politics would do ?
dk : you know , i believe that there are mindshare and then there for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is starting to be in the united states , no doubt , but the uk does it right and in other countries that does it right .
the people are starting to acknowledge that it in luck to think should be if we look at the political thinking .
it will be a while , and people will discuss that if you <unk> explore their desks or whether they <unk> look like , so we have that discussion pretty soon bring .
how fortunate to increase can go very differently depending how you think and if you look at the <unk> even think or she wanted to the <unk> even think .
this is politics can control , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you look at that <unk> the population start measuring .
this is , i think , in the next year or two decades of the national stats like .
well , it strikes me that this topic is , or should <unk> the most important political debate to track be about the next few years .
thanks for the invention of economics .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i make games .
i becoming now for 10 years <unk> . and my aim for the next decade is , it as easy to make , the world in reality to save as it in <unk> to save this is .
i have a plan for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time to play more and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
perhaps slightly too much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve this .
now , my research on the institute for the future has been , is the opposite accurately .

actually i am convinced that if we need to the next century on earth 's kind of people , we have this time dramatically increase of course .
i 've calculated that the kind of time in 21 billion hours of play time per week about .
this seems to start doing some <unk> , so again , i do this to work ca : if we problems like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity is to solve , i think we have to try to play online for least , 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty precise , why i believe that play so vital for survival of human species in the future are . seriously .
this is the picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted the feelings to play catch . so he was the players a camera put up .
it 's one of the classic expression of playing video .
if you have any players are , and avoid them some of nuances in this image .

if you also play , you see certain nuances here , which semen up <unk> eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows present surprise .
this is a player , it 's the edge of the so-called epic <unk> you can .
oh , you know the . all be neat . so we have some outstanding players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , this so extremely positive is that they were n't know that about it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it 's a shock , that they really do that can do . this is a <unk> victory .
these gamer is coming up an indian epic victory .
and this is what we on millions of faces of <unk> around the world in front of course , if we are challenging the next century are attacking . the face of those who in all giving in the edge of his epic <unk> are .
well , unfortunately , let 's sort of the face in real life if we difficult problems facing .
i call it as the in life as i got bad . <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , what i did `` in life as i got bad . <unk> do .
this is a graffiti on my former home at berkley , california where i in my ph.d. studying how we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem that many greatest players have .
we think that we in reality is not the best they 're like in games .
and i mean not only less successful , although it and as part .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean well in relation to the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to work together .
if we in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us into our best version turn , anytime and immediately <unk> is persistent , the problem solving try to have been so how much needed , it at a failure , again shot .
and in reality , if we fail , if we stumbled across barriers , bump , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel beat it . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings that we 've never , if we play games , in games are they simply not .
and that 's what i as <unk> study how did .
why is it into play , impossible to think , you could n't anything happen ?
how we can these feelings are to play in the reality spread ?

and i have some things started to the epic victories of <unk> so do .

but not just some mission , but a mission that are perfectly to its current level in games does , right ?
so they make it .
you 'll never a task that they do n't solve .

you 're not around and turns <unk> . it 's always be detected something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people who engage with you to your very epic mission to this problem .
so we in real life is not just , that feeling that at a <unk> tons employees set up .
and then is this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
it 's all of the positive feedback .

this constant feedback is n't there in real life .

i get in real life that feedback , not .

they 're just better than the reality .
yet empowered all have world of <unk> together <unk> million years , spent the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to think about it in context of vision : at <unk> million years i started our first <unk> upright to go .
the first upright <unk> so .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we are playing , spend , do it just point when you look at the time in terms of the scale of human flourishing looking at each holding what the most is .
but also very appropriate . because it turns out that we 're using these whole time looking at the play , pharmacological drugs that really change , what we as human being able to them .

this is the truth . believe me .
think about once this interesting statistic that recently from a researcher at carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours is an extraordinarily interesting number , from two reasons .
first , for children in america are <unk> hours to capture the <unk> that you in school to spend , from the fifth grade , up to leave high school . if you never absent .
so we 've got a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning what it means that a good players to be as anything , what they 're in school learn .
and maybe some of them in the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know his theory of your success , the theory 's success 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great science of <unk> that if we have 10,000 hours to and laborious study of any subject to the 21st century . age of spend , we 're going to rise in .
we 're pretty much we 're doing whatever to do what the most important people the world .
so what we have here , is an entire generation of young people who <unk> are .
the big question is so `` what exactly are starting player <unk> right ? ''
because if we find that might have we basically had never here <unk> human potential available .
so many people are currently in the world , the least an hour day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> : 500 million people who were extraordinarily well , `` something '' are .
and the next decade we have another billion players , which is exceptionally good in whatever that are .
if they 've never heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy savings and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online , you can play .
you 're expecting an extra billion player in this next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to contemplate what it 's , where the games to rise to do .
there are the four things that i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine that as extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , instantly wanted to do , a challenge to rise , with the belief that we have a <unk> hope to have success .
player is n't always remember that a <unk> victory possible , and that this is worth , it to try and that same .
players are not vice versa .
players are masters of spiders poet of social networks .
there 's a lot more interesting studies that indicate that we people more like , after we with you have played , even if you 're evil to beat up .
the reason is that 's a lot of trust takes , with someone a game to play .
we rely on that any time with us to spend that the rules <unk> going to be the same purpose and have to <unk> going to stay .
so allow this together the growing of ties to trust and together .
as a result , we build stronger kind of social relations in .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week is to speak , as <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we 're really happy with you to work hard , as if we want to relax or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal work , if we 're stiff , significant bidding .
and players are always ready , to work hard , if you the right up to do n't received .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love this , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> magnitude of this .
here a <unk> to go through rights to light back , you know definitely all of wikipedia , the biggest wiki the world .

five million people use it every month .

they create a epic story .

ok , so that 's four superpowers , which became a single thing to take action gamers are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it 's people who believe that they 're a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that you believe , you have the virtual worlds are changing , but not the reality .
this is the problem that i 'm going to solve try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he studies , why people much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 'll have live from nothing less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he goes ...
not just like me -- i becoming more games , i 'm doing something <unk> .
so he says , that does actually make sense , because player can in <unk> achieve more than in real life .
you can go into play a stronger kind of social ties that other than in real life -- they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently is entirely obvious that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree to first time to imagine that 's obvious .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start to the real world in a game in turn .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> there <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the work ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about how and why games have invented up .
according <unk> got games , particularly <unk> , the kingdom <unk> during a famine , up .
apparently had such a great famine , that the king of <unk> to a crazy idea that i decided that .
people have struggled . people fought .
it was an extreme conditions . it took an extreme solution .
so they invented , according <unk> that <unk> and <unk> a national energy strategy . in one day would you eat . next day you would play .
and they were so much in the <unk> <unk> be that i 'll play so fascinating , and connect to satisfying to <unk> productivity surrounding that you remember that would that 's nothing to eat out there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowed them as 18 years that famine , by one day where were eating and the following played .
likewise , i think it 's now play a .
we put play a to suffer the real world to escape .

but it does not the end to be .
this is the exciting .

they divided the kingdom on two halves .
you played a <unk> and the winner got to see this epic adventure to shift .
they were <unk> and took on the quest for a new home . they had just so many people back , as food to surviving there and went to the rest of an area where they 're thriving could .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> who grow the roman empire arose , the same dna as the old <unk> whatsoever .
so i did scientists recently at the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists thought evidence of global cooling , which almost 20 years about what the famine tell you could .
and you might the crazy story to vote .
maybe they 've actually their people through the same ones saved by looking at 18 years in games <unk> have and then this <unk> had and so much about the other ones who learned that it makes the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .

it was the first <unk> in real time the world of <unk> . it was 16 years before .

i want to say , we 're ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent the half of civilization in the quest for a new world . so i took my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> that half of us an hour a day to play spend , until we really hard of the real world have solved .
i know , they will say `` how we solve problems the real world in play ? '' and this particular question i mean work in recent years of the institute for the future of the expectation .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it push out how we the future should figure out .
we do n't want to try and the future ahead to say .
what we want it 's the future to make .
we want to make the most results ; and then why people again , this idea in the reality home .
we imagine epic victories of and give people the possibility of reaching them .
we 'll take a comment about three different games that i 've designed to try to people epic victories by your own future to speak up .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is in 2007 .
it 's a game where you a <unk> overcome these issues .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> so it for it looks realistic , and your real life in fact , without oil our lives . so if you going to play <unk> , just tell us , where you live . and then you get <unk> in real time , and you will show how much oil costs , what does n't exist as food at risk is , as transportation affected by selfridges to school closed , whether it causes riots in there . and they have to figure out how your real life make when it 's true about it . and we ask them , about to blog , video or a kind hiring .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 test . and we have you ever since over the last three years traveling .
and i can say , it was changing the experience .
nobody wants to his life change , because it is good at the environment is , because we should .
but if it in epic adventure , and told you get `` we 're going to get oil . ''
this is one amazing man , which of you go .
you find out how to survive her community . most of gamers have the game learning habits maintained .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher purpose expertise as just <unk> .
we have the game `` <unk> '' the institute for the future of its own .
baseline is the calculations of <unk> , that people can only have 23 years in the planet ended up .
this massive supercomputer called global <unk> <unk> , '' right .

you know jerry <unk> where it 's called `` <unk> '' is . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just crashed , you can save the world .
but in our games , instead of only five people , say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player up playing the game was five weeks ' worth .
they were 500 incredibly creative solutions that you read can be if `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game we trick at 3 . march out . it 's a game in conjunction with the world bank .
if you the game to conclude , they gain from the world bank , the distinction `` social <unk> , 19 degree in 2010 .
we work with universities in very <unk> and they invite one , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic to . we have `` level up , for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all invited to this game with young people to share this around the world , especially in <unk> , the benefit to move along their own social enterprises presenting to the world to rescue .
i 'm going to the end .
i want you some questions .
what you think that happens next ?
we 've all those fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have the real world 's not be saved .
well , i hope to me how do agree that players human resources are we have to work in real life to use can , and that play a great significance to change in .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social networks to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we all the eminent play games to all earth 's another century to survive .
and i hope you 're going to me like play design and play .
if i want to the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things not sure , that we each <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games are beginning !
thanks .
i 'd just like to share something that led me , a few months at writing an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write more and my <unk> fingertips , but i was to edit the <unk> already done , and i noticed that i never happened in my life <unk> have what the word has helped '' actually means .
i read them a post about .

<unk> : well , strong , powerful . ''
i have this list a friend says , reading and i had just nonsense , it seemed so ridiculous , but i came to , at `` <unk> '' and could n't <unk> , and had to stop reading and once i do with this <unk> <unk> and the way <unk> emotional shock .
obviously this a <unk> , old <unk> . i 'm just thought that the readout pretty age should .
but actually it was a copy of the early '80s when i just with the elementary started , and started to my model elsewhere in my family terribly building and to form , in terms of other kids and the rest world around me .
and thank god , i did n't <unk> used .
i 'd like this post take seriously i 'd be in the world was born that someone like me as a person would perceive , whose lives in <unk> way beneficial in order to say . today , but i want to the opportunity and adventure , which i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately went the <unk> of 2009 called and expect that i got a <unk> contributions to find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she 's not much better .
especially shock to the last two words of `` <unk> <unk> '' `` well , '' `` well . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about what we thought about people think that we with these words describe .
it 's about the values that in these words stuck , and how to those values , constructing weights .
our language affects our thinking and how to the world , and people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the the greek and the roman , have really believed that the sound reinforcement of <unk> a great force , because what you hear it <unk> , it can manifest .

just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could do , you know about curtailing and share ideas <unk> .
it would not nice , you doors to open up ?
a person , the top of my door opened , there was my pediatrician in <unk> . dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can imagine , most americans did n't counted correctly tell you could eat . so he became increasingly , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful fly and was for the work with kids out how we created .
i found the time that i in this hospital , i spent , just great -- except for my <unk> .
i had one practice does n't seem to infinity often , again with its fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> building . and i have these down at all hated worse than anything else . i did they hated it . i have you 're haunted . i did they hated it .
and imagine ago , i whistled even been known as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so trying to this exercise to stop , <unk> not succeeding .
and one day he let me at a i practiced observation -- this exercise was just tiring and mercilessly , and he told me , `` wow , is aimee , you 're like a lot of <unk> and young girl , you will be one day one of the ligament organs .
and when you create , i give you hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just a simple trick of dr. p. so i their exercises do that i did n't want to do with the prospect that richest five-year-old kid in the ward in second stick to be . but he got me actually get started to my daily <unk> through fresh eyes to see . so , it became a new and <unk> experience .

this is just an example of many , like adults in <unk> the imagination a child engaging together .


the medical records of view from outer you can also say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium or artificial <unk> for <unk> body that allow people , really all their opportunities to use and over the borders who share their natural fortune was set out of out to develop , not going to talk about social <unk> platforms that people make up with my own identity , put on your way of redefining , and that the world to groups that 's leaders who you to enlist .
maybe it gets so this technological change experience because the that it always had another truth gave , namely , that every human society as something very <unk> and very <unk> can give you and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to -- it 's an interesting story because people me every time to ask to tell , i do with giving in the deal and i 'm about something ta : this phrase that has to me never <unk> and i 'm always very uncomfortable with it felt that 's worth of getting people to answer , and i think , gradually i understand , why .
this phrase from our dealings with giving in the living by the idea that success or happiness in it depends , a challenge to rise , regardless of them together can experience has become . like my life so successful order is , because i the potential to fall of life with a prosthetic way that could n't it anyway that people to me with my disability to sense .
but the truth is that we change . so we are from the challenge coined , whether you physically , emotionally , or , both is
and i claim that this is good .
giving is no obstacle that we <unk> need to have our lives better to cope .
giving in some easy to our lives .
and i tend to giving in as my shadow of vision .
sometimes i realize that he was really present is , sometimes it 's hard to see , but it 's always with me .
and i want to save the impact , or the heavy of <unk> a person <unk> .
there are in life was giving and challenges , and they 're just <unk> real and every person walks them differently about . but the question is n't know if we 're giving in the right now , or not , but the way that we really clear understanding .
so we 're not just responsible for that people that we love , before <unk> to maintain , but they also to prepare , well , in order to cope .
and we provide our kids did n't like when we tell you feel that give you ca n't be able to fit .
you have two things that falls apart : first of the medical fact , an amputee , to be and the second societal argument about whether i helped me or not .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability , with that makes me apart , put it had to is that the world , always think , you ca n't help me with definitions that describe .
in our desire , people to protect have , we care are and you the cold , hard truth about their medical projections to communicate or even a prediction for quality to imagine that you expect , we have to watch out that we 're not the foundation to put that somebody actually has helped is .

if you do n't holistically and treat , and not all its structural forces and opportunity to sense , and recognizing do in addition to the natural struggle that you might lead to , another disease .
we <unk> a person who had to our society , this is worth .
so we have about the <unk> beyond watching and us to every area of human possibility to focus .
at a sustainable and is that between the perception of mismatch and our magnificent ingenuity , a connection there .

it 's me , maybe more about making sure enough to imagine that we 're giving not necessarily through these issues , but that we use to open , you to hug , rather you <unk> to put in order to go get <unk> to use , maybe even in order to dance .
and maybe do it , giving up as a natural , <unk> and useful to see and feel ourselves as through their presence n't get strained .
so this year celebrate the 200 birthday , by charles darwin and when he had 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my view , at something very true in the human nature -- pointed out .
i 'd like to paraphrase `` do n't the best performing their way it anyway , or neither of <unk> its way , but now , who was changes in the best fit in .
in conflict -- comes about creativity .

so , again , change and embrace is the great skills of man .
and maybe we know yet , which of wood , we clay , if we really ethics into .
perhaps is exactly the point of giving up with perception of swings , the sense of our own power .
we can not true self starts to pay .
we can be giving a new meaning that matter , over the tough times beyond the point .
we may giving of climate change those .
giving up for a change that we have n't have adapted .
i think most of damage that we ourselves <unk> have is to believe that we normally should be .
's face -- who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there are the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , gray person 's really familiar to learn when they 're really convinced ?
i think them not .
we would love , if we do that paradigm of normality versus another the capabilities or the strength to it even slightly dangerous to proposing that 's working could . we get the forces of lots of kids who release and they do you invite your special and valuable skills in the society , emotionally .
<unk> have found that we humans from the members of our society ever get a claimed that have , useful to be and a contribution to do .

there are these people wo n't be broken and useless level ; they were as a treat and valuable treated .
by a few years , i went in the city in which i raised was , in a <unk> in the `` red zone , '' at northeastern part of pennsylvania , and i was there in a <unk> tomato .
it was the summer and i had <unk> on .
and i hear , like a guy behind me say , `` well if this is aimee <unk> is . ''
and i turn to my mom and see this elderly gentleman . i had no idea who he is .
and i meant `` sorry , sir , we know ourselves ? i 'm not to you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they appear to do n't remember me .

oh , so the .
so obviously has to do it actually click done .
now , dr. <unk> , a guy that i just like narratives of my mother about this day before , because i course , of typically , to my birthday , two weeks late for coming .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was on holiday , and so i knew my parents the man who was born , matched , nothing .
and because i do n't <unk> was born , and my feet up after them pointing had and i just a few toes in this and some toes in other foot felt like he was the <unk> , these strangers who had to the bad news <unk> .

really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , collected , anyway , if i was in a <unk> in the second grade , i had gained , if i want to get <unk> on parade of <unk> road was , however , if i was my scholarship and dying from my cups victories <unk> had , and he was using these clips to the students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of <unk> the x factor , the potential human willing .
you ca n't extol to how critical of the factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> talked further , he said `` i learned that kids , if you do n't always something else said to get , and even if you just some help teachers get to get kids its leaves , can get kids very much anywhere . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has been thinking about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone that donor shortfall , two different things are .

i wanted to go back to have normal work .
if you me that today 's worth , i 'm not quite sure .
and that 's happening because i have something with my legs , i 've experienced and not and despite their experiences .
and perhaps could this relating to happen because i was so many people face am that my door opened up , instead of people to address that i cut or me an idea <unk> wanted .
you see , it takes just a person who you demonstrates how to take their powers manifest can , and they 're going down .
if you find somebody 's going to be able to his own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do this , and for someone in a critical moment a door to open , then you 're for those people a very good teachers .
they teach them on themselves , doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' was rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means to produce that in one is , the potential <unk> .
again , what opportunity , we hope because now there ?
in the '60s was in britain a <unk> done . were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. and call it as `` <unk> . ''
the students appropriately after college grading divided .
and the a student will <unk> harder ethics , get better teacher , etc .

so obviously <unk> you to the heart to listen to be subverted the <unk> they said , they were just enough .
and similarly , it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones who still in school were -- apart from the students that the school <unk> had .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers not <unk> were .
the teachers did n't know that something changed was .
they were just told that are the student and that the students with the note enough . and as you have you something about teaching and they have treated .

if we did n't want to create , the human spirit of energy to support to continue to hope to yourself and other people around them are finding , inquisitive and <unk> to be then put our power genuinely positive a .
if a spirit of those qualities , mandate , we can get a new reality and new <unk> create .

come to dance with me . thanks .
